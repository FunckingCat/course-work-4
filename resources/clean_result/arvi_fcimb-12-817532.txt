Epithelial cells are an important line of defense within the lung. Disruption of the epithelial
barrier by pathogens enables the systemic dissemination of bacteria or viruses within the host
leading to severe diseases with fatal outcomes. Thus, the lung epithelium can be damaged by
seasonal and pandemic inﬂuenza A viruses. Inﬂuenza A virus infection induced dysregulation
of the immune system is beneﬁcial for the dissemination of bacteria to the lower respiratory
tract, causing bacterial and viral co-infection. Host cells regulate protein homeostasis and the
response to different perturbances, for instance provoked by infections, by post translational
modiﬁcation of proteins. Aside from protein phosphorylation, ubiquitination of proteins is an
essential regulatory tool in virtually every cellular process such as protein homeostasis, host
immune response, cell morphology, and in clearing of cytosolic pathogens. Here, we analyzed
the proteome and ubiquitinome of A549 alveolar lung epithelial cells in response to infection by
either Streptococcus pneumoniae D39Dcps or inﬂuenza A virus H1N1 as well as bacterial and
viral co-infection. Pneumococcal infection induced alterations in the ubiquitination of proteins
involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPases, but had minor effects
on the abundance of host proteins. H1N1 infection results in an anti-viral state of A549 cells.
Finally, co-infection resembled the imprints of both infecting pathogens with a minor increase
in the observed alterations in protein and ubiquitination abundance.

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory tract infections are among the most prevalent causes of death worldwide (Roth et al.,
2018). These infections are mainly caused by inﬂuenza A virus (IAV), Streptococcus pneumoniae
and other pathogens (Aliberti and Kaye, 2013; Troeger et al., 2019). Infections with IAV can cause
dissemination of bacteria to the lower respiratory tract allowing viral and bacterial co-infection
(Ruuskanen and Järvinen, 2014; Self et al., 2017). Thus, viral and bacterial co-infection is related to

increased mortality compared to single infections (Palacios et al.,
2009; Hammerschmidt, 2016; Cawcutt and Kalil, 2017).
Recently, it has been shown that co-infection occurs in
seasonal and pandemic IAV infection in more than 30% of all
cases (Brundage, 2006; Morens et al., 2008). The Gram-positive
bacterium S. pneumoniae is mainly associated as secondary
infection in IAV infected patients (Palacios et al., 2009).
Inﬂuenza A virus infection can cause disruption of the
epithelial barrier and impaired immune response causing
bacterial spreading and reduced bacterial killing (Siemens
et al., 2017). In the lung, epithelial cells act as an important
line of defense and are involved in pathogen sensing and
initiation of the host immune response (Vareille et al., 2011;
Hiemstra et al., 2015). Among others, posttranslational
modiﬁcations of proteins, like protein phosphorylation and
ubiquitination, regulate processes within the host cell. Proteins
can be modiﬁed with various types of ubiquitination like
monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination. Ubiquitin, a
protein of 76 amino acids, is covalently linked to the e-amine
group of lysine residues in target proteins and thus, regulates
their stability, localization or interaction properties. The function
of ubiquitination depends on the length and linkage type of the
ubiquitin chain. Furthermore, ubiquitin is involved in the
regulation of immunity and clearance of intracellular
pathogens (Bhat and Greer, 2011; Zinngrebe et al., 2014; Hu
and Sun, 2016). It was demonstrated previously that bacterial
and viral pathogens are able to manipulate the ubiquitin
proteasome system (UPS) to evade the host defense. Moreover,
host ubiquitin is misused by inﬂuenza A viruses to facilitate
particle uncoating and transport within the host cell (Rudnicka
and Yamauchi, 2016; Yamauchi, 2020). Here, we infected type 2
lung epithelial cells (A549) with a pandemic IAV, with S.
pneumoniae D39Dcps, and conducted viral and bacterial coinfection to elaborate the effects of these infections on protein
abundance and on protein ubiquitination. We enriched for K48
and K63 polyubiquitinated proteins, because these ubiquitin
chains are the most dominant within the lung tissue, and
applied label free LC-MS/MS based quantiﬁcation. The results
of this study contribute to the understanding of the ubiquitin
mediated regulatory processes during viral and bacterial
co-infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial and Viral Strains
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39Dcps, a non-encapsulated mutant
of D39 was described earlier (Saleh et al., 2013).
The pandemic inﬂuenza A/H1N1 virus [A/Germany-BY/74/
2009(H1N1)] was kindly provided by the Institute of
Immunology (FLI, Federal Research Institute for Animal
Health) (Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany).
Cell Culture and Infections
A549 alveolar type 2 lung epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-185) were
cultured in T75 ﬂasks in RPMI medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C in 5%
CO2 atmosphere. For infection experiments, cells were seeded
into T75 ﬂasks and grown to 80-90% conﬂuence. 2 h before all
infections the medium of A549 cells was exchanged by RPMI
without FCS.
Bacteria were grown at 37°C in Todd Hewitt broth
supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY) to midexponential phase (OD600 of 0.35-0.40). Pneumococci were
washed and resuspended in PBS prior to infection. A549 cells
were infected with S. pneumoniae D39Dcps at a MOI of 15 and
were harvested 6 h post infection.
For viral infections, A549 cells were infected at a MOI of 5.
After 2 h the medium was replaced by RPMI supplemented with
10% FCS and cells were harvested 24 hours post infection. Viral
replication was conﬁrmed via qRT-PCR (Supplementary
Figure S1).
For co-infections, A549 cells were infected with IAV followed
by bacterial infection. Cells were infected with IAV at a MOI of 5.
After 2 h the medium was replaced by RPMI supplemented with
10% FCS and infected cells were cultured for additional 20 h at
37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Then, 2 h before bacterial infection,
media was changed to RPMI without FCS. Hereafter, A549 cells
were infected with S. pneumoniae D39Dcps (MOI 15) for 6 h.
At the end of the infection period cells were washed with PBS
and cells were detached using trypsin and counted. Cell counts
were determined by light microscopic quantiﬁcation of cell
viability. Cells were stained with 0.4% (v/v) trypan blue under
serum-free conditions and visually examined.
All experiments were performed in triplicates (n=3).
Interleukin ELISA
ELISA plates (Human IL-6/IL-8 Max Deluxe Set [BioLegend])
were coated with capture antibody and incubated for 16-18 h at
4°C. Plates were washed (PBS + 0.5% Tween-20). Hereafter,
plates were blocked with blocking solution for 1 h with shaking at
200 rpm. Furthermore, standard series were prepared (IL-8: 1000
pg/ml – 15.6 pg/ml, IL-6: 500 pg/ml – 7.8 pg/ml). Non-speciﬁc
bindings were blocked, blocking solution was removed and plates
were washed. Standards and cell culture medium samples were
added to the plates and incubated for 2 h with shaking. After the
plates were washed, they were incubated with the detection
antibody for 1 h. The detection antibody solution was removed
and plates were washed. Avidin-HRP solution was added and
incubated for 30 min with shaking. Avidin-HRP solution was
removed and plates were washed. TMB substrate solution was
added and incubated for 15 min in the dark. Stop solution (2 N
H2SO4) was added and absorbance was measured at 450 nm and
570 nm within 15 min.
Protein Extraction
Protein extraction was performed as described elsewhere (Sura
et al., 2021). Brieﬂy, harvested cells were resuspended in 1 ml
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.5], 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1% NP 40, 10% glycerol, 1x cOmplete Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail [Roche], 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 20
µM MG132), sonicated to shear DNA and cleared by

centrifugation. Protein concentration of the samples was
determined by the BCA assay.
Selective Enrichment of K48 and K63
Ubiquitinated Proteins
Lysates containing 500 µg of total protein were transferred into
new tubes and ﬁlled to 300 µl with lysis buffer. To reduce
unspeciﬁc binding of proteins to magnetic beads, 10 µl of
magnetic control beads (LifeSensors) have been added to the
samples and were incubated in an overhead shaker for 1 h at 10
rpm and 4°C. Afterwards, supernatants were transferred into
new tubes. For the enrichment of K48 ubiquitinated proteins, 40
µl of K48 magnetic TUBE HF (LifeSensors), washed with Trisbuffered saline with Tween20 (TBS-T), were added, followed by
an incubation for 3 h at 10 rpm and 4°C. To enrich K63
polyubiquitinated proteins, 700 µl water and K63 Flag-TUBE
(LifeSensors) with a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM were added to
the precleared sample and incubated for 2 h at 10 rpm and 4°C.
Subsequently, 8 µl of magnetic anti-Flag beads were added and
samples were incubated for additional 2 h. The unbound fraction
of both enrichments was removed and the beads were washed
three times with 500 µl TBS-T. To elute the enriched proteins,
beads were resuspended in 25 µl SDS buffer (5% SDS; 50 mM
TEAB; 5 mM TCEP) and incubated at 65°C for 45 min with 300
rpm shaking. Finally, the supernatants were transferred into
new tubes.
Proteolytic Digest
Extracted and enriched ubiquitinated proteins were digested by
suspension trapping on micro S Traps (Protiﬁ) as described
elsewhere (Sura et al., 2021). Brieﬂy, lysates containing 30 µg
protein were transferred into new tubes and disulﬁde bonds were
reduced by adding TCEP. Thiol groups were alkylated by adding
iodoacetamide for proteome samples or chloroacetamide for
ubiquitinome samples. Proteins were digested by adding 25 µl
digestion buffer (50 mM TEAB) containing 1.2 µg trypsin for
proteome samples and 600 ng trypsin (Promega) for ubiquitin
enriched samples followed by an incubation for 3 h at 47°C.
Peptides were subsequently eluted with 40 µl 50 mM TEAB; 0.1%
acetic acid; 60% ACN in 0.1% acetic acid. All eluted fractions of a
sample were pooled and dried in a vacuum concentrator. Dried
peptides were stored at -80°C
Peptide Fractionation
Peptides generated from crude protein extracts were fractionated
by off-line high pH reversed phase chromatography as described
elsewhere (Sura et al., 2021).
LC-MS/MS Analysis
The peptide composition of the generated samples was analyzed
by LC-MS/MS with an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) coupled to a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). Peptides were loaded onto in-house packed
fused silica columns of 20 cm length and an inner diameter of 75
µm, ﬁlled with ReproSil Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 µm (Dr. Maisch).
Peptides were subsequently eluted by a non-linear binary
gradient of 165 min from 2% to 99% solvent B (0.1% acetic
acid in acetonitrile) in solvent A (0.1% acetic acid). Detailed
information on the gradient and LC setup can be found in
Supplementary Table S1. MS/MS data for the proteome and the
K48 ubiquitin chain enriched samples were acquired as
previously described (Sura et al., 2021). For the K63 ubiquitin
chain enriched samples the mass spectrometer was operated in
DDA mode. The survey scan was acquired from 300-1650 m/z
with a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m/z. The 10 most abundant
ions were selected for fragmentation via HCD with a normalized
collision energy of NCE 27. The AGC target was set to 1E5 with
an underﬁll ratio of 10% and a maximum injection time of 180
ms. MS/MS spectra were acquired in centroid mode with a
resolution of 17,500 at 200 m/z. Ions with unassigned charge
states as well as charge 1 and higher than 6 were excluded from
fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s and lock mass
correction was enabled. Detailed information on the MS/MS
acquisition parameters for all datasets are provided in
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.
Database Search
Datasets of enriched polyubiquitinated and total proteome
samples were processed separately. Raw data were searched
with MaxQuant (version 1.6.17.0) (Cox and Mann, 2008; Cox
et al., 2014) against the UniProt databases for human (July 2019,
UP000005640, 20,416 entries), Inﬂuenza A virus (A/GermanyBY/74/2009(H1N1)) (December 2017, UP000153067, 10 entries)
and for S. pneumoniae D39 (September 2020, UP000001452,
1,915 entries). The maximum number of allowed missed
cleavages was 2 and precursor mass tolerance was set to 4.5
ppm. Carbamidomethylation (C) was set as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation,
oxidation (M) and acetylation (protein N‐termini) were set as
variable modiﬁcations for both datasets. GlyGly (K) was set as an
additional variable modiﬁcation for K48 and K63 ubiquitin chain
enriched samples. Proteins were identiﬁed with at least two
unique peptides, and peptide-spectrum match (PSM) and
protein false discovery rate (FDR) were set to 0.01. Match
between runs was applied and protein abundances were
calculated by the MaxLFQ algorithm. A detailed table of
applied parameters for database searching can be found in
Supplementary Tables S4 and S5.
Data Analysis
Identiﬁed protein groups were analyzed with Perseus (version
1.6.15.0) (Tyanova et al., 2016; Tyanova and Cox, 2018). Only
identiﬁed by site and reverse hits, as well as potential
contaminations were removed. To assess differentially
expressed proteins, a two tailed t test was applied for proteins
with “LFQ intensity” values in three out of three replicates of the
compared groups. Proteins were considered as differentially
expressed with a p value < 0.05 and a fold change > 1.5.
Quantiﬁcation results and summary statistics can be found in
Supplementary Table S6. Functional annotation enrichment of
proteins with signiﬁcantly changed abundance was performed
with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery (DAVID v6.8) (Da Huang et al., 2009a; Da Huang
et al., 2009b) and Reactome (Jassal et al., 2020). Protein
interaction networks were created with STRING (v11.0)

(Szklarczyk et al., 2019). Data were visualized using Inkscape
(version 0.92.2) and RStudio (version 1.3.1073) with the
packages ggplot2 (version 3.3.5), dplyr (version 1.0.6),
EnhancedVolcano (version 1.4.0), splitstackshape (version
1.4.8), shadowtext (version 0.0.8) and ggpubr (version 0.4.0).
Data variance was assessed by calculation of CVs from proteins
with quantitative values in all three replicates (Supplementary
Figure S2).
RESULTS
To investigate the effect of bacterial or viral mono-infections and
bacto-viral co-infections we infected A549 cells at a MOI that
does not kill the majority of the A549 cells within the analyzed
time frame. Also, we aimed to explore, whether the co-infection
will be more severe to A549 cells than the infections with a single
pathogen. Therefore, we analyzed the proteome and
ubiquitinome of mono- and co-infected A549 cells.
Cell Count and Interleukin Secretion
A549 cells were grown to 80%-90% conﬂuence. Hereafter, cells
were challenged either with the inﬂuenza A virus H1N1, S.
pneumoniae D39Dcps, or both pathogens in a viral bacterial
co-infection. After 24 h of viral infection the A549 cell count
signiﬁcantly increased by more than 25% (Supplementary
Figure S3). This indicates that IAV propagation does not
interfere with A549 proliferation within the observed time
frame. In contrast, a 25% reduced cell count was observed after
6 h of S. pneumoniae infection. After co-infection the number of
cells did not change compared to the uninfected control.
Cell culture supernatants of each infection were used to
determine the levels of secreted immune modulating effectors.
The average (n=3) level of IL-6 and IL-8 was increased after S.
pneumoniae infection and bacto-viral co-infection
(Supplementary Figure S4), but not after single viral infection.
In detail, there is a difference in IL-6 and IL-8 levels when
comparing the bacterial single infection or the co-infection with
the corresponding mock infection. In contrast, there is no
difference between the single H1N1 infection and the
associated mock infection. Therefore, the H1N1 infection does
not lead to an increased interleukin production.
Differentially Abundant Proteins in
Proteome and Ubiquitinome
For all experiments, the PSM FDR and the protein FDR have
been set to 0.01. Proteins were considered as signiﬁcantly
changed in abundance, when they were quantiﬁed in all three
replicates of the compared groups with a fold change greater than
1.5 and a p-value below 0.05. This, in total, resulted in the
identiﬁcation of more than 90,000 peptides, enabling
quantiﬁcation of more than 5,800 proteins for the proteome
data set. In the proteome of A549 cells 74, 37 and 107 proteins
were found to be signiﬁcantly changed in abundance upon H1N1
infection, S. pneumoniae infection, and co-infection, respectively
(Figure 1A). H1N1 infection induced the accumulation
of various proteins, whereas the S. pneumoniae infection
mainly led to decreasing protein abundances. Moreover,
different sets of proteins were effected by viral or bacterial
infection. This is also reﬂected by the low overlap between
these infections (Figure 1B).
After enrichment of polyubiquitinated proteins we were able
to identify more than 34,000 and 9,800 peptides, from the K48
and K63 enriched samples, respectively. This enabled the
quantiﬁcation of more than 2,800 proteins after K48
enrichment and more than 850 proteins in the K63 enriched
data set (Figure 1A). In contrast to the proteome and K63
polyubiquitin enriched data sets, S. pneumoniae infection
induced more changes than H1N1 infection in the K48
polyubiquitin enriched data set. Comparison of the proteins,
which were differentially expressed upon viral and bacterial
infection, revealed only a limited number of shared proteins
between the single infections (Figures 1A, C, D). To elaborate
whether altered abundance detected for proteins in the
polyubiquitin enriched data sets originates from alterations in
protein abundance in general, we examined the overlap of
proteins that were detected with altered abundance in those
data sets (Supplementary Figure S5). Whereas upon
pneumococcal infection three proteins were detected with
differential expression in the proteome and K48 enriched
samples, 18 and 15 proteins were differentially expressed in the
proteome and K48 enriched data set upon viral and co-infection,
respectively (Supplementary Figure S5). This indicates that in
most cases altered abundance in polyubiquitin enriched samples
is independent of variations in the abundance of the respective
proteins. Hence, differential abundance in polyubiquitin
enriched data sets is caused by changing polyubiquitination
incidence rather than by changing protein abundance. Volcano
plots and MA plots, comparing the different conditions are
shown in Supplementary Figures S6–S8.
Functional Analysis of Proteins
Differentially Expressed in the Total
Proteome Samples
To get detailed insights into the processes driving the cellular
response to the infecting pathogens, we used the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to
perform annotation enrichment on proteins with signiﬁcantly
changed abundance.
Infecting A549 cells with H1N1 signiﬁcantly altered the
abundance of 74 proteins within the proteome samples. The
abundance of 63 proteins was increased and decreased for eleven
proteins. Functional annotation enrichment revealed that type I
interferon, ISG and other terms, which represent a response to
viruses, were mainly enriched within proteins of increased
abundance (Figure 2A). No terms have been enriched from
proteins with reduced abundance (Figure 2A).
In the proteome of S. pneumoniae infected A549 cells only 37
proteins were detected with signiﬁcantly altered abundance,
among them we detected ten with increased abundance and 27
with decreased abundance. Here, the terms oxidation-reduction
process (p-value = 0.00022) and regulation of translation (p-value =

0.0055) were enriched from proteins with reduced abundance. In
contrast to the H1N1 infection, no terms were enriched from proteins
with increased abundance.
Viral and bacterial co-infections of A549 cells mainly affected
Gene Ontology Biological Process-terms (GOBP-terms) similar to
those enriched in single infections. Proteins with increased
abundance were annotated for GOBP terms defense to virus, type I
interferon signaling pathway and ISG15-protein conjugation. The
term oxidation-reduction process was enriched from proteins with
decreased abundance (Figure 2B). In general, there is a reasonable
quantity of proteins detected with the same regulation between the
single infection and the co-infection (Figure 1B). Additionally,
several proteins were quantiﬁed in the H1N1 and co-infection, but
were missing in uninfected and S. pneumoniae infected samples.
These proteins are MX1, MX2, IFI44, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIH1,
which are all involved in type I interferon signaling and viral defense.
Furthermore, 17 proteins that are included in the integrated
annotations for Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin-like Conjugation
Database (iUUCD 2.0) (Zhou et al., 2018) and 2 proteins that are
catalytically active subunits of the immunoproteasome as well as
the proteasome activator subunit beta (PA28beta) were detected
with altered protein abundance upon infection (Table 1).
Functional Analysis of Differentially
Abundant Proteins in K48 Enriched
Samples
As ubiquitination is involved in the regulation of nearly every
cellular process, we selectively enriched for K48 and K63
polyubiquitinated proteins. It was demonstrated that K48 and
K63 polyubiquitin chains are the most abundant chain types in
murine primary macrophages and in murine lung tissue (Heunis
et al., 2020). K48 ubiquitination has a variety of functions in the
eukaryotic cell. Still, the primary function is to mark proteins for
proteasomal degradation.
After 24 h of H1N1 infection, there were fewer changes in
protein abundance detected in K48 enriched samples compared
to total proteome samples. GOBP terms that were most
signiﬁcantly overrepresented from proteins with increased
abundance in the K48 enriched samples were defense response
to virus, type I interferon signaling pathway and negative

regulation of viral genome replication, while RNA splicing was
most signiﬁcantly overrepresented from proteins with
decreased abundance.
Upon S. pneumoniae infection we detected altered abundance
of 108 putatively K48 polyubiquitinated proteins. Fifty-nine
proteins were quantiﬁed with decreased abundance and 49
with increased abundance after infection. Only three out of 37
proteins detected with differential expression in the proteome
samples were detected with altered abundance in the K48
polyubiquitin enrichment. Proteins with decreased abundance
in K48 polyubiquitination mostly affected processes involved in
mRNA splicing and rRNA processing. Arp2/3 complex mediated
actin nucleation and other processes related to actin ﬁlament
organization were highly overrepresented by proteins with
increased K48 polyubiquitination. In addition to actin ﬁlament
related processes, FC-gamma receptor signaling pathway involved
in phagocytosis was enriched from proteins with increased K48
polyubiquitination, as well.
In the viral and bacterial co-infection the pattern of proteins
with signiﬁcantly changed abundance after K48 enrichment is
similar to both of the single infections. Moreover, the coinfection shares ~50% and ~15% of differentially expressed

proteins with the bacterial and the viral infection, respectively
(Figure 1C). Proteins that were shared between the single
infections change their abundance into the same direction.
Although the STRING network, which was generated from the
co-infection (Figure 3B) data, has a high similarity to the
network generated from the bacterial infection (Figure 3A), it
also contains a cluster of proteins that has been detected upon
viral infection (response to virus) (Figure 3B). Furthermore, eight
proteins were found to be changed signiﬁcantly in all infections
and three of them are related to RNA splicing (Figure 1C). Ten
proteins were only quantiﬁed in the viral and in co-infection
samples. These proteins affect the processes of response to virus,
type I interferon signaling pathway and interferon-gammamediated signaling pathway.
Functional Analysis of Differentially
Abundant Proteins in K63 Enriched
Samples
In contrast to K48 polyubiquitination, K63 polyubiquitin chains
are thought to mediate non-proteasomal signals for endocytosis
and immune responses. The K63 enriched data set displays the
lowest number of quantiﬁed proteins within the three data sets
obtained in this work. Accordingly, the K63 data set reveals fewer
proteins detected with altered abundance. H1N1 infection
induced variations in the K63 polyubiquitination level of 30
proteins. Proteins with reduced K63 ubiquitination affect
mRNA splicing processes and proteins with increased K63
ubiquitination affect redox processes. Changes induced by the S.
pneumoniae infection do not affect multiple pathways, only
negative regulation of mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization involved in apoptotic signaling pathway is
affected by proteins with increased K63 polyubiquitination. Coinfection most signiﬁcantly affected processes involved in mRNA
processing from proteins with decreased polyubiquitination.
Proteins with increased polyubiquitination affected redox
processes and response to ER stress.
DISCUSSION
In the work presented, we used in vitro cell culture based
infection experiments to examine potential synergistic effects of
the infecting pathogens in viral and bacterial co-infections on
human lung epithelial cells. Therefore, we analyzed viral and
bacterial mono-infections, along with bacto-viral co-infections of
A549 cells, focusing on the proteome, as well as the selective
enrichment of polyubiquitinated proteins. Infecting A549 cells
with H1N1 for 24 h induced a pronounced immune response
and viral defense of the host. The additional bacterial infection
was performed at MOI 15 to be able to elaborate a potential
synergisms of the pathogens.
Response to IAV H1N1 Infection
Inﬂuenza H1N1 infection induced a strong viral defense
response of the A549 cells. This was established by the
induction of the JAK-STAT cascade, type I interferon
signaling, interferon g signaling and induction of the ISG15
protein conjugation. Induction of the type I interferon
production mediated by RIG-I and MAVS, which leads to the
induction of a wide array of genes, can be assumed from
increased protein abundance of interferon stimulated genes
(Schoggins et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, we
detected a 25 fold increase in the abundance of DDX60 which
was shown to be required for RIG-I mediated type I interferon
expression after viral infection (Miyashita et al., 2011). From the
proteins with higher abundance after viral infection, nine show
E3 ligase activity and one protein is described as an E2 enzyme
(Zhou et al., 2018) (Table 1). Among these proteins are HERC5
and TRIM25, both acting as E3 ligating enzymes for ISG15

(Wong et al., 2006; Mathieu et al., 2021), which increased twelve
and ﬁve times in abundance in our experiments, respectively.
UBE2L6, the ISG15 E2 transferring enzyme, was detected to be
ﬁvefold more abundant after viral infection. These results are in
concordance with previously published data where an upregulation of UPS genes in response to Interferon-stimulation
was detected (Seifert et al., 2010). This, together with the
increased abundance of the transcription factor IRF9, which
induces the transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISG)
when forming a complex with STAT1 and STAT2, underpins the
interferon mediated activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.
OAS1-3 are degraders of viral RNA (Shim et al., 2017) and
were also detected with increased abundance after viral infection.
Moreover, increased protein abundance of the ubiquitin E3 ligase
DTX3L and the interacting protein PARP9 as well as of PARP10,
12 and 14 was observed in IAV infected A549 cells. These results
conﬁrm the ﬁndings on increased protein abundances of PARP9
and PARP14 upon viral infection, ﬁrst observed by Becker and
colleagues (Becker et al., 2018). We were able to conﬁrm these
results using a different inﬂuenza strain, but the same cell line. It
is reported by others that the outcome of the IAV infection
depends not only on the MOI and the duration of the infection,
but also on the cell line, as well as the employed viral stain
(Becker et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019). Inﬂuenza virus infection
predispose the host cell to secondary bacterial infections, which
was shown from mice and in vitro experiments (Sharma-Chawla
et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021). Bai and coworkers demonstrated
that viral infection induced an increase in the abundance of
PPIA, which interacts and mediates protection from proteasomal
degradation of PTK2. Ultimately, this results in increased
integrin a5 expression and actin rearrangement, which renders
the host cell more susceptible for secondary bacterial infection
(Bai et al., 2021). In contrast, we have not detected signiﬁcant
changes in the abundance of PPIA and integrin-a5 in the
proteome nor in the abundance of PTK2 in the proteome and
K48 enriched data set. These differences in the outcome of the
viral infection can potentially be caused by several reasons. First,
observed differences were caused by the use of different inﬂuenza
strains. The second reason can be the infection duration and the
MOI at which the experiments were conducted. Bai et al. showed
that the mRNA level of PPIA reached its maximum at 12 hpi and
decreased afterwards (Bai et al., 2021). The use of a higher MOI
may result in a shifted maximal mRNA level and CypA
expression. The reason causing the observed differences
remains unclear. We can exclude the cell line as a cause, as we
used A549, too. In addition, Becker et al. have not observed
changes in the protein abundance of CypA or ITGA5 after IAV
infection of A549 cells, as well (Becker et al., 2018).
Response to Streptococcus pneumoniae
Infection
The pneumococcal infection induced differential abundance
of 37 proteins. Furthermore, we detected 108 and 16 proteins
with signiﬁcantly altered abundance in K48 and K63
polyubiquitination, respectively.
The protein that showed the most prominent increase in
abundance (about four fold) was PTGS2 or COX-2, being an
inducible protein involved in the initial step of prostaglandin
synthesis. In type II alveolar epithelial cells the induction of the
COX-2 expression in response to pneumococci is controlled in a
p38 MAPK and NFkB dependent manner (N'Guessan et al., 2006;
Szymanski et al., 2012). Bootsma and colleagues also observed an
induction of COX-2 by the Dcps mutant of S. pneumoniae
analyzing the transcriptional response of Detroit 562 pharyngeal
epithelial cells to the adherence of different pneumococcal strains
(Bootsma et al., 2007). They have shown that S. pneumoniae D39
and its isogenic Dcps mutant alter the expression of different gene
sets. Infection with the Dcps mutant changed the expression of 156
genes (28 upregulated and 128 downregulated) (Bootsma et al.,
2007). Given the fact that Detroit 562 cells are of pharyngeal origin
and A549 cells are lung epithelial cells, the published results
cannot be entirely transferred to our study. Nevertheless,
Bootsma et al. also observed an increase in IL-6 and IL-8 levels
upon S. pneumoniae D39Dcps infection (Bootsma et al., 2007)
(Supplementary Figure S4).
Bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumoniae use different
strategies like transmigration or transcytosis to cross epithelial or
endothelial barriers of the host. Pneumococcal uptake by A549 cells
is low, however, A549 cells show increased uptake of S.
pneumoniae D39Dcps compared to the wild type strain (Talbot
et al., 1996; Bootsma et al., 2007). Still, it was shown that
pneumococcal phosphorylcholin mimics the natural ligand of
PAFr initiating bacterial uptake in a b-arrestin dependent
manner (Radin et al., 2005; Bertuzzi et al., 2019). Pneumococcal
endocytosis is clathrin and caveolae mediated and the vast majority
of endocytosed pneumococci is killed by lysosomal fusion of the
endosome (Gradstedt et al., 2013). Pneumolysin, a cholesteroldependent cytolysin expressed on the pneumococcal surface and
released by autolysis, disables the acidiﬁcation of the endosome by
the formation of pores in the endosomal membrane (Barnett et al.,
2015; Ogawa et al., 2018). The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)
is involved in the autophagosomal entrapment and killing of
cytosolic pneumococci (Iovino et al., 2014; Ogawa et al., 2018).
Additionally, pneumolysin directly interacts with actin and
activates small GTPases leading to remodeling of the actin
network (Hupp et al., 2013). Rho GTPases act upstream of the
Arp2/3 complex, which facilitate actin nucleation and is involved in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis (Sirotkin, 2011;
Sumida and Yamada, 2015; Jin et al., 2021). In our study, we
observed increased abundance in K48 polyubiquitination of
proteins belonging to the Arp2/3 complex and other actin and
cytoskeleton organization related GO terms (Figure 3A).
Moreover, the Reactome analysis revealed that Rho-GTPase
signaling is affected by proteins with increased K48
polyubiquitination, as well. Thereby, polyubiquitination bridges
the host proteome and ubiquitinome in response to pneumococcal
infection. These results are not in contrast to the ﬁnding that S.
pneumoniae D39 effectively overcomes the epithelial barrier by
transmigration (Attali et al., 2008). We have not observed any
changes in the abundance of junction proteins as it was described

by Peter and colleagues (Peter et al., 2017). This could be due to the
use of a single cell line and no lung tissue.
In our K48 polyubiquitin analysis we detected reduced
polyubiquitination in proteins involved in mRNA splicing and
rRNA processing. Proteins involved in mRNA splicing mainly
belong to the spliceosomal E complex. Changes in the
spliceosome composition may indicate an early apoptotic state
of the epithelial cells, linking the spliceosome and apoptosis
(Schwerk and Schulze-Osthoff, 2005). It remains unclear what
causes these effects upon pneumococcal infection and is a subject
of future studies.
In addition to the K48 polyubiquitin analysis, Reactome analysis
of proteins with altered abundance in K63 polyubiquitination also
indicated involvement of the Rho-GTPase cycle, whereas the
functional annotation enrichment analysis of K63 polyubiquitinated
proteins showed only negative regulation of mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization involved in apoptotic signaling pathway
as an overrepresented GOBP term.
Viral and Bacterial Co-Infection
Bacterial and viral co-infections are related to increased severity
of disease, increased morbidity and mortality (Siemens et al.,
2017; Lim et al., 2019). Inﬂuenza A virus infection, caused by
pandemic or seasonal strains, predispose the host to secondary
bacterial infections (Sharma-Chawla et al., 2016; Siemens et al.,
2017; LeMessurier et al., 2020). In our experiments we could not
observe an increased cytotoxicity of the co-infection compared to
bacterial or viral single infection (Supplementary Figure S3).
Following the co-infection we observed similar IL6 and IL8 level
compared to the bacterial single infection (Supplementary
Figure S4). Unexpectedly, preceding viral infection reduced
pneumococcal adherence to A549 epithelial cells in our
experimental setup (Supplementary Figure S9). Still, viral and
bacterial co-infection resulted in the highest number of proteins
with signiﬁcantly altered abundance on protein and
polyubiquitination level. Interestingly, we did not detect over
representation of pathways that have not been identiﬁed upon
one of the two single infections. For all obtained data sets the
pathways affected by co-infection resembles both of the single
infections. This is in congruence with a previous study where we
reported additive effects of IAV H1N1 and Streptococcus
pyogenes co-infection of 16HBE cells (Sura et al., 2021).
Nevertheless, here we have detected enhanced alteration of
protein abundance and polyubiquitination incidence upon coinfection. This effect on protein abundance was also noticed for
PSMB8, PSMB9 and for PSME2 (Table 1). These proteins are
immunoproteasome subunits and proteasome activator
PA28beta and are involved in altered generation of MHC I
antigenic peptides presented to CD8 T-cells (Keller et al., 2015;
McCarthy and Weinberg, 2015). The further increase in protein
abundance upon co-infection might be induced by enhanced
IFN-g production caused by the bacterial superinfection as it was
reported by Strehlitz and coworkers from mice experiments
(Strehlitz et al., 2018). Upon co-infection higher numbers of
proteins with signiﬁcantly altered abundance were detected in all
data sets when compared to the single infections. Still, these
observations are not reﬂected by an increased cytotoxicity of the
viral bacterial co-infection.
In the presented study we used S. pneumoniae D39Dcps, an
isogenic mutant that lacks the capsular polysaccharides. Thus,
the outcome of the study and the observed alterations in the
proteome and the ubiquitinome were potentially inﬂuenced by
the absence of capsular polysaccharides. However, the
interaction between A549 cells and the pneumococci is mainly
based on bacterial adherence to the cell surface (Agarwal et al.,
2010). It has been shown that the intimate contact of
pneumococci with host cells is associated with a reduction of
CPS (Hammerschmidt et al., 2005). While encapsulated wildtype pneumococci interact only moderately with nonprofessional host cells under in vitro conditions, binding can
be enhanced using isogenic non-encapsulated mutants. Thereby,
the induced signal transduction cascades can be elucidated and
the host responses analyzed. Although this is not related to the
pathophysiological conditions under in vivo conditions,
important discoveries were made in the last decades using this
combination of bacteria and host cells.
Importantly, we chose a MOI of only 15 bacteria per host cell
to reduce the level of host cell damage caused by pneumolysin
and hydrogen peroxide to a minimum in the bacterial single
infections and co-infections. In in vivo studies higher bacterial
infection doses are applied to study the effects in experimental
acute pneumonia or septicemia infection models.
In in vivo experiments, co-infection appears to be adverse for
the host, caused by the IAV induced expression of type I
interferons suppressing the bacterial clearance by disturbed
recruitment of immune cells (LeMessurier et al., 2020; Park
et al., 2021). On the other hand, type I interferons increase the
expression of tight junction proteins and decrease the expression
of PAFr, reducing pneumococcal uptake and hindering
transmigration (LeMessurier et al., 2013). The in vitro study
presented here is based on A549 cells grown as a monolayer.
Due to the lack of immune cells and their interaction with the
epithelial barrier in our setup, this adverse effect was probably not
observed. Furthermore, A549 cells grown as a monolayer do not
form tight junctions (Carterson et al., 2005). The scarcity of tight
junctions might explain the fact that we did not observe changes in
the expression of tight junction proteins, whether induced by type
I interferons, or by pneumococcal infection, as it was observed in
lung tissue (LeMessurier et al., 2013; Peter et al., 2017).
It can be concluded that IAV and S. pneumoniae D39Dcps coinfection of monolayer grown A549 cells shows additive, but in
the current setup no observable synergistic effects. It would be
interesting to investigate whether this changes in polarized, 3D
grown A549 cells and to determine the impact of the
pneumococcal virulence factor pneumolysin.
