Secondary bacterial infections following inﬂuenza infection are a pressing problem facing
respiratory medicine. Although antibiotic treatment has been highly successful over recent
decades, fatalities due to secondary bacterial infections remain one of the leading causes
of death associated with inﬂuenza. We have assessed whether administration of a bacterial extract alone is sufﬁcient to potentiate immune responses and protect against primary
infection with inﬂuenza, and secondary infections with either Streptococcus pneumoniae or
Klebsiella pneumoniae in mice.We show that oral administration with the bacterial extract,
OM-85, leads to a maturation of dendritic cells and B-cells characterized by increases in
MHC II, CD86, and CD40, and a reduction in ICOSL. Improved immune responsiveness
against inﬂuenza virus reduced the threshold of susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, and thus protected the mice.The protection was associated with enhanced polyclonal
B-cell activation and release of antibodies that were effective at neutralizing the virus.Taken
together, these data show that oral administration of bacterial extracts provides sufﬁcient
mucosal immune stimulation to protect mice against a respiratory tract viral infection and
associated sequelae.

INTRODUCTION
Recurrent respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality, with therapeutic options largely limited
to traditional antibiotic treatments (1). The cause of susceptibility
to RTIs is varied,but overall reﬂects an inability of the immune system to prevent productive infections (2). Thus, treatment regimes
that enhance the immune system’s effectiveness are a valid and
rational approach.
The immune system is immature at birth,and following microbial colonization and host-microbe interactions, it matures and
develops the capacity to effectively control infections (3). Studies utilizing axenic (germ-free) mice, which harbor no microbes,
have shown that in the absence of microbial colonization, there
is lymphopenia, drastically reduced levels of mucosal IgA, and
impaired epithelial barrier integrity (4). Recent research highlights
the importance of host–microbe interactions in both health and
disease, and these data support the concept of modulating the
host microbiota by utilizing prebiotics or probiotics for disease
prevention (5). An alternative approach is the direct administration of puriﬁed microbial components or bacterial extracts
that provide maturation signals to the immune system (6–9).
Indeed, both clinical and experimental studies have shown that
administration of bacterial extracts can be efﬁcacious in numerous disease settings such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
recurrent respiratory and urinary tract infections of bacterial
or viral origins, wheezing lower respiratory illness (WLRI), and
subsequent asthma (10, 11).
Experimental studies support the concept that exposure to
bacterial components may inﬂuence the response to a variety
of pathogens. Mice pretreated with an aerosolized Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae lysate were protected against respiratory infection with
a variety of pathogenic bacteria and fungi, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Bacillus anthracis, and Aspergillus fumigatus (12). The same treatment also protected mice against nebulized inﬂuenza virus (13).
In the 90s, and more recently, clinical studies demonstrated that
treatment with a bacterial extract, OM-85 (marketed as BronchoVaxom, Broncho-Munal, Ommunal, Paxoral, Vaxoral), was effective against different RTIs (14–17). Efﬁcacy in reducing morbidity
was also shown with OM-85 in children affected by recurrent
RTIs (18) and signiﬁcantly reduced the rate and duration of virusinduced WLRI in preschool children with acute RTI (19). As with
the general inﬂuence of microbial colonization, the immune stimulatory pathways elicited by bacterial extracts are varied. Recent
data indicate that TLR4 and TLR2 could be stimulated by OM-85
(20), and an inﬂuence upon expansion of T regulatory cells and
enhancement of T helper type 1 responses has been reported (21).
In the present investigation, we have assessed the efﬁcacy and
mechanism of action of OM-85 in mouse models of respiratory
infections. OM-85’s active principle ingredients are composed
of soluble extracts of lysates from 21 bacterial strains (5 pathogenic bacterial genera) that are mainly responsible for RTIs [H.
inﬂuenzae, Streptococcus (pneumonia, pyogenes, and sanguinis),
Klebsiella (pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae and pneumoniae ssp.

ozaenae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis]. It is
utilized in adults and in children as of 12 months of age for
immunotherapy, prevention of recurrent infections of the respiratory system and acute and chronic bronchitis, and co-medication
in the treatment of acute respiratory infections. We show that
treatment of mice with OM-85 acts to enhance innate and adaptive arms of the immune system with consequently improved
control of inﬂuenza virus infection. As reported previously in
inﬂuenza vaccination studies (22, 23), such enhanced immunity
had highly relevant consequences for secondary infections, where
it led to improved outcomes following subsequent challenge by
either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The mechanism
of action underlying the OM-85 mediated protective effect was
unique in that it involved the induction of polyclonal mucosal
antibody responses that neutralized viral particles, thus blocking
the infection. This innate antiviral response was also associated
with enhanced adaptive CD8+ T-cell response, indicating that the
actions of OM-85 were multifactorial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MICE AND INFECTIONS
Female BALB/c mice aged 8 weeks were purchased from Charles
River. Inﬂuenza virus strain PR8 (A/Puerto Rico8/34, H1N1)
was sourced from Virpur (San Diego). Viral infections were performed by intranasal administration of 100 PFU of virus in 50 µl
of PBS. S. pneumoniae strain D39 glycerol stocks were inoculated into 5 ml of BHI Broth and incubated overnight at 37°C
and 5% CO2, without shaking. After 24 h, 50 ml of BHI broth
was inoculated with 500 µl of overnight stationary culture in a
250 ml ﬂask, and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2, without shaking.
The culture was sampled at several time points (5, 6, 7, and 8 h),
O.D. 620 nm was determined and CFU/ml controlled by plating bacteria on Mueller Hinton + 5% sheep blood agar plates.
Mice were infected intranasally with 50 µl of the bacterial solution containing 1 × 105 CFU. For preparation of K. pneumoniae,
5 ml of Nutrient Broth (NB) was inoculated with glycerol stock in
a 14 ml round-bottomed tube and incubated at 37°C with shaking. After 24 h, 50 ml of NB was inoculated with 500 µl of the
overnight stationary culture in a 250 ml ﬂask followed by incubation at 37°C with shaking. The culture was sampled at several
time points to measure O.D. at 620 nm and CFU/ml controlled
by plating bacteria on NB plates. Mice were infected with 50 µl
of the bacterial solution (endotoxin and DNA free content) containing 101 CFU of bacteria. For in vivo experiments, daily gavage
of mice with 7.2 mg of OM-85-active principle (corresponding
to 320 µL concentrate) or its equivalent without bacterial extract
(referred to as “control solution”) was performed during 10 days.
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines and Swiss Federal and Cantonal Laws on
Animal Protection.
Quantiﬁcation of bacterial load in blood
Twenty-four hours following infection, blood was sampled and
serially diluted followed by plating on LB (Klebsiella) or Mueller
Hinton + 5% sheep blood (Streptococcus) agar plates and incubation overnight at 37°C. Following 24 hours of incubation,bacterial
colonies were counted and CFUs extrapolated.
Disease scoring
In all, 1 point for a healthy mouse; 2 points for a mouse showing signs of malaise, including slight piloerection, slightly changed
gait, and increased ambulation; 3 points for a mouse showing
signs of strong piloerection, constricted abdomen, changed gait,
and periods of inactivity; 4 points for a mouse with enhanced
characteristics of the previous group, but showing little activity
and becoming moribund; and 5 points for a dead mouse.
ANTIBODIES AND FLOW CYTOMETRY
Different combinations of the following antibodies were used for
ﬂow cytometry. For analysis of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in
the lung, a combination of CD11b PerCP-Cy5.5, CD11c APCCy7, B220 FITC, MHC II Alexa Fluor 700, CD40 PE, ICOS-L
PE, CD80 PE, or CD86 PE was used. Analysis of B-cells subsets was performed with CD19 PE, CD23 PE-Cy7, CD21 Paciﬁc
Blue, IgD FITC, and IgM APC. Inﬂuenza-speciﬁc CD8+ T-cells
were stained with NP-tetramer 366–374. All antibodies were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego) unless indicated. Stained cells
were acquired on a BD FACS CANTO or LSRII and analyzed with
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
QUANTITATIVE REAL-TIME PCR
Total RNA was puriﬁed from cells obtained from whole
lung and trachea of mice using Tri reagent (Sigma Aldrich).
Real-time PCR was carried out according to manufacturers’ instructions using the quantifast SYBR green RT-PCR
kit (Qiagen). The following primers were used: beta-Actin
forward 5′-CCCTGAAGTACCCCATTGAAC-3′ and reverse 5′CTTTTCACGGTTGGCCTTAG-3′; inﬂuenza matrix protein forward 5′-GGA CTG CAG CGT AGA CGC TT-3′, reverse 5′-CAT
CCT GTT GTA TAT GAG GCC CAT-3′. Data are represented as
the ratio of the Cq values from the inﬂuenza matrix protein gene
to the house-keeping gene, beta-Actin.
Analysis of cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage and lungs
BAL was performed by ﬂushing the airways twice with 500 µl of
PBS/0.1% BSA. Total cell counts were determined using a Beckmann Coulter Counter. Cells from BAL were spun onto glass
slides using a Cytospin 3 (Shandon). Slides were then stained
using Diff Quick staining set (Dade Behring, Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics, Deerﬁeld, IL, USA) and differential cell counts were
determined microscopically. Percentages of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes were determined within
a total population of 200 cells.
For isolation of cells from the lung, lungs were perfused with
PBS and then digested in medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml
Collagenase IV (Invitrogen-Gibco). Single cell suspension was
obtained by smashing digested lungs through a 70 µM cell strainer
(Milian Falcon).
In vitro activation of splenocytes
Spleens were isolated from BALB/c mice and pooled. Tissue was
placed in IMDM media containing collagenase, cut into approximately 2 mm cubes and incubated for 45 min at 37°C with gentle shaking. Following the incubation, the remaining tissue and
media was pressed through 70 µm cell strainers and washed with

PBS containing 0.2% BSA. Red blood cells were lysed, and cells
were counted using a Coulter Counter (IG Instruments, Zurich,
Switzerland). Cultures with 1 × 106 cells per well in 48 well plates
(Nunc) with a volume of 500 µl media were setup in triplicate.
Cells were stimulated with OM-85 at concentrations of 1 mg/ml,
100 µg/ml, 10 µg/ml, 1 µg/ml, or 0 µg/ml.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Student’s t test (unpaired, two-tailed) or a one-way ANOVA was
used to calculate signiﬁcance levels between treatment groups,
as indicated. Graph generation and statistical analysis were performed using Prism version 5 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA,
USA). Standard deviation (SD) was used.
RESULTS
THE BACTERIAL EXTRACT, OM-85, ELICITS AN ENHANCED INNATE
RESPONSE THAT CONTROLS INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTION
In order to gain insight into whether and how treatment of mice
with OM-85 could enhance antiviral immunity, mice were treated
orally with OM-85 for 10 days followed by infection with a sublethal dose of inﬂuenza A virus (Figure 1A). In this well-deﬁned
infection model, the peak of viral load is on day 5 post-infection
and the virus is cleared by day 10 post-infection (24). Mice treated
with OM-85 had a lower viral load in the lung tissue on day 5
post-infection as compared to mice treated with the control solution, which had undergone the same manufacturing process as
OM-85, but without the bacterial extracts (Figure 1B). On day 10
post-infection, both groups had cleared the virus, as expected,
showing that OM-85 treatment did not prolong the infection
(Figure 1B). Analysis of the cellular inﬁltrates into the airways
following infection showed that the OM-85 treated mice had a
reduced proportion of neutrophils in the airways on day 5 postinfection (Figure 1C). These data corroborated the reduced viral
load and indicated that the protective mechanism associated with
OM-85 treated mice involved very early control of the infection, and as a consequence of this early control, the neutrophilic
response resolved faster. Although the OM-85 mediated protective effect in this case was linked with time points associated

Enhanced mucosal antibody production and protection
with the innate antiviral response, an enhanced adaptive CD8+
T-cell response was noted on day 10 post-infection (Figure 1D).
These data suggest that the actions of OM-85 were multifactorial,
enhancing both innate and adaptive immune pathways, but the
early innate response was likely to be responsible for the efﬁcacy
against inﬂuenza virus.
OM-85-MEDIATED ENHANCED ANTIVIRAL IMMUNITY RESULTS IN
PROTECTION AGAINST SECONDARY BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
In both human beings and mice, a consequence of respiratory
viral infections, particularly inﬂuenza, is an enhanced susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections (22, 23, 25). To place the
OM-85-mediated enhanced antiviral immunity into this highly
clinically relevant setting, we treated mice with OM-85 and on day
7 following an inﬂuenza infection mice were exposed to a sublethal dose of either K. pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae (Figure 2A).
In the absence of any treatment, the infectious doses of the bacteria that were utilized resulted in mild infections with no weight
loss, temperature loss, or signs of morbidity in the bacterial
infection only groups, while the dose of inﬂuenza resulted in a
transient weight loss (data not shown). However, when inﬂuenza
infected animals were subsequently given the low-dose bacterial infection, bacteremia was present in control treated mice,
while pre-treatment with OM-85 protected mice from the bacteremia (Figure 2B). Moreover, OM-85 treatment protected mice
from the sequelae resulting from the secondary bacterial infections including weight/temperature loss, and morbidity scores
(Figures 2C,D).

Enhanced mucosal antibody production and protection
OM-85 ENHANCES DENDRITIC CELL MATURATION
Given the protective effect of OM-85 against viral infections and
consequently secondary bacterial infections, we next investigated
how OM-85 shaped DC activation states, considering that DCs
are one of the most potent cell types that inﬂuence immunity
and have recently been shown to be activated by OM-85 (26).
Accordingly, splenocytes were isolated from naïve mice and stimulated with different doses of OM-85 in vitro. OM-85 treatment
led to a dose-dependent increase in the surface expression of
MHC II (Figure 3A), CD40 (Figure 3B), and CD86 (Figure 3C)
on both CD11b+ and CD11b−DC populations indicative of
an increased activation state. Interestingly, not all markers were
upregulated as a clear dose-dependent reduction in costimulatory ligand; ICOSL was found in these same cell populations
(Figure 3D). We next investigated whether these markers were
regulated in vivo and found similar trends in surface marker
expression on lung DCs (Figures 3E,F), although no changes
were evident on splenic DCs (data not shown), suggesting OM85 elicited a mucosal tissue-speciﬁc effect. Given MHC II and
the costimulatory molecules, CD40 and CD86 were increased by
OM-85, it is likely that this effect was linked with the observed
increase in inﬂuenza-speciﬁc CD8+ T-cell responses (Figure 1D),
although it does not necessarily explain the rapid protection
against the virus, which was already apparent in the ﬁrst days
post-infection prior to when the CD8+ T-cell response had
developed.
OM-85 ENHANCES B-CELL ACTIVATION STATES AND PRODUCTION OF
POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES
To further dissect the possible mechanism through which OM-85
protects mice against inﬂuenza infection and subsequent secondary bacterial infection, we next characterized its effect upon
B-cells. In an approach similar to the DC analysis, we stimulated splenocytes with different concentrations of OM-85 and
assessed their activation state. Similar to the DC response, CD40
(Figure 4A) and CD86 (Figure 4B) were upregulated in a dosedependent manner on B1 B-cells, Follicular B (FB) cells and
marginal zone (MZ) B-cells. However, contrary to the DCs,

these B-cell populations exhibited no signiﬁcant changes in their
expression of ICOSL except, to a minor extent, in MZ B-cells
(Figure 4C). In order to determine whether these OM-85 driven changes in B-cell maturation had consequences in vivo, we
administered OM-85 for 10 days by gavage as performed previously (Figure 1A), and then assessed IgG and IgA in the serum
and airways of mice. OM-85 treatment alone led to a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the levels of IgG detected in the serum of
mice and trends toward increased IgA and IgG in the airways
(Figure 5A). Of note, however, there was a statistically significant increase in IgA isolated from the serum or airways that
bound to inﬂuenza antigens (Figure 5B). This was particularly
intriguing because the OM-85 treated mice had not been infected
with the virus in this setting. Moreover, antibodies that bound
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also detectible in the OM85 treated groups (Figure 5C). These data indicate that OM-85
treatment had led to a polyclonal B-cell activation that resulted
in release of antibodies against multiple antigens. Although we
could detect comparably higher levels of these antibodies in
OM-85 as compared to control treated mice, their relevance was
unclear. Thus, to assess whether these polyclonal antibodies had
functional implications, we tested their ability to limit inﬂuenza
virus infection. Indeed, in an in vitro virus neutralization assay,
heat-inactivated serum or BAL ﬂuid from OM-85 treated mice
was effective at limiting inﬂuenza infection (Figure 5D). Taken
together, these data indicate that OM-85 can act to protect mice
against inﬂuenza infection by enhancing B-cell activation and
release of broadly protective antibodies that help to protect the
host against infection.
DISCUSSION
The underlying risk factors for recurrent RTIs are poorly understood,and the treatment options are limited (27).We hypothesized
that one means of addressing this clinical issue would be to provide
stimulationtotheimmunesystemthatmightdirectitinsuchaway
as to improve mucosal barrier protective pathways. Indeed, some
of the most fundamental signals received by cells associated with
the mucosa, come from microbes. This host–microbe cross-talk is

Pasquali et al.
Enhanced mucosal antibody production and protection
essential for induction of appropriate immune pathways that limit
microbial invasion.
Overall, we have found that oral administration of a bacterial
extract is sufﬁcient to protect animals from a viral infection, as
well as the severe consequences of secondary bacterial infections
following Inﬂuenza. Huber and colleagues have previously shown
that oral administration of OM-85 leads to increased levels of IgA
in Peyer’s patch and mesenteric lymph node culture supernatants
(28). The fact that oral administration of the extract was able
to increase IgA and improve mucosal immunity in the airways
adds weight to the concept of the “common mucosal immune
system”; however, formal mechanistic data showing how intestinal responses inﬂuence the respiratory tract are still very limited.
It is possible that stimulation of immune cells in the intestinal
associated lymphoid tissue results in recirculation of cells to other
mucosal sites; alternatively, components of the bacterial extract
might reach the circulation and then directly inﬂuence cells in
the lung, or precursor cells destined for the lung. Considering the
absence of surface marker changes observed in vivo from spleen
cells (data not shown), this is, however, unlikely to be the case. In
the current study, it appears that OM-85 was capable of activating
a number of different cell types, such as DCs, B–cells, and T-cells.
Macrophage phenotypes were also changed albeit with different
markers (data not shown). The B-cell stimulation, in particular, could be considered within the context of innate stimulation
and the enhancement of a natural non-afﬁnity matured antibody
repertoire, capable of binding many different antigens. Indeed, we
found that OM-85 treatment resulted in the release of antibodies capable of binding to inﬂuenza and RSV, even in the absence
of speciﬁc exposure to those pathogens. Although these antibodies are unlikely to have an afﬁnity comparable to those having
undergone afﬁnity maturation, they were still effective at blocking
viral infection. From studies of germ-free mice, it is known that
microbial stimulation is critical for the induction of IgA barrier
immunity; now our data show oral administration of a bacterial
extract alone was capable of improving this fundamental arm of
mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract (Figure 6).
In this study, we also assessed the effect of OM-85 upon DC
maturation. Perhaps expectedly, stimulating DCs with a bacterial
extract resulted in their activation, as noted by increased levels of
MHC II, CD40, and CD86. It is intriguing, however, that ICOSL
expression was speciﬁcally downregulated following OM-85 stimulation. While it is possible that ICOSL follows different kinetics
than these other markers, ICOSL–ICOS interactions have particularly been associated with allergic Th2 responses, and OM-85
has been linked with protection against allergic responses (10).
Thus, this effect on downregulation of ICOSL expression could
indicate one important component of its mechanism of action.
Clearly, further studies are warranted in order to dissect the functional consequences of the MHCIIhiCD86hiCD40hiICOSLlo DCs
in promoting protective immunity, while enhancing regulatory
pathways against allergy.
Taken together, this study highlights the importance of microbial stimulation of the immune system for maintaining effective
mucosal immune barriers. We show that oral administration of
bacterial products is sufﬁcient to improve systemic and respiratory tract antibody levels, and that the increased presence of these
antibodies is associated with enhanced control of primary respiratory viral infection and secondary bacterial infections. These data
support the concept of boosting our immune system by providing non-deleterious microbial stimulation for the prevention and
treatment of RTIs.
