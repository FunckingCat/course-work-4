Acute respiratory infections by inﬂuenza viruses are commonly causes of severe
pneumonia, which can further deteriorate if secondary bacterial infections occur.
Although the viral and bacterial agents are quite diverse, defensins, a set of antimicrobial
peptides expressed by the host, may provide promising biomarkers that would greatly
improve the diagnosis and treatment. We examined the correlations between the gene
expression levels of defensins and the viral and bacterial loads in the blood on a
longitudinal, precision-medical study of a severe pneumonia patient infected by inﬂuenza
A H7N9 virus. We found that DEFA5 is positively correlated to the blood load of inﬂuenza
A H7N9 virus (r = 0.735, p < 0.05, Spearman correlation). DEFB116 and DEFB127 are
positively and DEFB108B and DEFB114 are negatively correlated to the bacterial load.
Then the diagnostic potential of defensins to discriminate bacterial and viral infections
was evaluated on an independent dataset with 61 bacterial pneumonia patients and
39 viral pneumonia patients infected by inﬂuenza A viruses and reached 93% accuracy.
Expression levels of defensins in the blood may be of important diagnostic values in clinic
to indicate viral and bacterial infections.

INTRODUCTION
Acute respiratory infections by inﬂuenza viruses are commonly the causes of severe pneumonia,
which can further deteriorate if secondary bacterial infections occur (McCullers, 2014). Accurate
detection of inﬂuenza virus infections and the potential secondary bacterial infections is important
to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe pneumonia. Because the viral and
bacterial agents are quite diverse, seeking a broad-spectrum test based on only the characteristics
of pathogens is currently still a challenging task. Although the rapidly developed next-generation
sequencing (NGS) technology provides a powerful tool to catalog the taxonomic composition of
clinical samples, the great technological complexity and high price makes it hard to adopt in clinic
soon. Identifying biomarkers that can be readily adopted into clinic is urgently needed. Because
diﬀerent pathogens can result in convergent host responses, identifying broad-spectrum diagnostic
biomarkers from the host response is probable. With the rapid development of high-throughput
biomedical technologies, the gene expression proﬁles of host blood can now be readily obtained.

Defensins Correlate to Bacterial/Viral Infection
Recently several groups have reported in succession that the
gene expression proﬁles of a certain set of genes in the
human blood can robustly discriminate bacterial infections from
viral infections and a series of bioinformatics tools have been
developed to identify the associations between microbes and host
health (Ramilo et al., 2007; Edelman et al., 2009; Zaas et al., 2009;
Parnell et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2013; Mejias et al., 2013; Peng et al.,

compartments of the body (Ganz, 2003). These great properties
of defensins indicate that they may be good candidates of
diagnostic biomarkers to discriminate bacterial/viral infections.
However, the currently reported gene signatures identiﬁed with
human blood gene expression proﬁles seldom include defensins.
It is of pressing need to ﬁnd out the clinically diagnostic values of
defensins.
To reach the objective, we proﬁled the gene expression levels
in blood and the viral and bacterial loads in plasma of a severe
pneumonia patient infected by inﬂuenza A H7N9 virus via
the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology along with
the disease progression. Then we examined the correlations
between the expression levels of defensins and the viral and
bacterial loads in the blood. Although many defensins did not
demonstrate statistically signiﬁcant correlations with either the
viral or the bacterial loads, the p-values of several defensins
did reach the statistical signiﬁcance cutoﬀafter multipletesting corrections. And these statistically signiﬁcant defensins
demonstrated mutually exclusive correlations with the viral loads
and the bacterial loads, suggesting that defensins are of great
diagnostic values to discriminate viral and bacterial infections.
Upon this observation, we then examined the diagnostic
potential of defensins on an independent dataset with 61 bacterial
pneumonia patients and 39 viral pneumonia patients infected
by inﬂuenza A viruses (Parnell et al., 2012) via a machine
learning method, which conﬁrmed again that defensins are of
great diagnostic values to discriminate bacterial infections from
viral infections. These results suggest that expression levels of
defensins in the blood may be of important diagnostic values in
clinic to indicate viral and bacterial infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Longitudinal Gene Expression Proﬁles of a
Severe Pneumonia Patient Infected by
Inﬂuenza a H7N9 Virus
The severe pneumonia patient infected by inﬂuenza A H7N9
virus was admitted to hospital on Day 5 after illness onset and
died on Day 29. Since Day 6, blood samples were collected for
every three days, i.e., on Days 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27
after illness onset. The total RNA was isolated and then subjected
to sequencing on Illumina Solexa GA II with read length of
80 bp (see Hu et al., 2015 for the technical details). Cuﬄinks
(version 2.1.1, with default parameters) (Trapnell et al., 2010)
was used to quantify the gene expression proﬁles of defensins
after mapping the quality-controlled reads to human genome
(GRCh37 and Gencode19) using Tophat (version 2.0.10, with
default parameters) (Kim et al., 2013). This study was reviewed
and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of
Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and
Peking Union Medical College. Written informed consent was
obtained for the use of peripheral blood samples from the
patient’s relatives. This study was carried out in accordance
with the recommendations of the Institute of Pathogen Biology,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical
College. The protocol was approved by the Institute of Pathogen

Quantifying the Microbial Species Infecting
in the Blood Samples
To quantify the microbial species infecting in the blood
samples, a metagenomic analysis method was applied. In detail,
the same sequencing reads were aligned to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide database by BLASTN (version 2.2.22,
with parameters “-e 1e-10 –b 10 –v 10”) (Altschul et al.,
1997). Then, the results were parsed and visualized by the
MEGAN software (Huson et al., 2007, 2016; Mitra et al., 2011),
upon which those reads speciﬁcally mapped to bacterial or
viral genomes were counted and exported as the bacterial/viral

viral/bacterial loads. Speciﬁcally, given the expression levels of
a defensin at all the eight time points xi where i = 1, ..., 8
and the normalized loads of a speciﬁc bacterial/viral species yj
wherej = 1, ..., 8, ranks rx and ry were ﬁrstly obtained and then
the correlation was calculated according to the following formula:
rxy = cov(rx, ry)
σrxσry
(1)
Where cov(rx, ry) is the covariance of the rank variables and σrx
and σry are the standard deviations of the rank variables. For each
pair of defensin and microbial species, the corresponding p-value
was also calculated, which was further subject to multiple testing
correction by the Benjamini and Hochberg method.
Validating the Diagnostic Value of
Defensins On Independent Datasets
An independent cohort of 100 pneumonia patients (61 bacterial
and 39 viral) were used to validate the diagnostic value
of defensins and associated genes (NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus, access number: GSE40012) (Parnell et al., 2012).
The whole blood gene expression proﬁles were quantiﬁed by
Illumina HT-12 gene-expression beadarrays. Expression levels of
defensins and associated genes were then extracted for clustering
and classiﬁcation analysis. For clustering analysis, t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (van der Maaten and
Hinton, 2008) was ﬁrst used to reduce the dimensionality of the
data to two for visualization and then a clustering method based
on searching density peaks (Rodriguez and Laio, 2014) was used
to cluster the samples into two groups. For classiﬁcation analysis,
the popular random forest method (Breiman, 2001) was used to
evaluate the diagnostic value via a leave-one-out cross-validation
method. The diagnostic value of defensins and associated
genes was further validated on two additional independent
datasets. One dataset included 12 children’s admitted to
Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus infections
and 10 children’s admitted to viral infections by inﬂuenza viruses
(NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, access number: GSE6269)
(Ramilo et al., 2007). The other dataset included 67 bacterial and
113 viral infections for adults (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus,
access number: GSE63990) (Tsalik et al., 2016).
RESULTS
Evident Associations of Different
Defensins to the Bacterial And Viral Loads
of H7N9 Pneumonia Patients
It is evident that inﬂuenza H7N9 virus demonstrated two peaks
in the patient blood (from Day 6 to Day 12 and from Day
18 to Day 24), with days from Day 12 to Day 18 forming
a valley (Figure 1A). However, at Day 18, a huge peak of
Acinetobacter baumannii infection appeared which declined in
the following days with small ﬂuctuations (Figure 1A). The total
of 30 defensins measured (4 α and 26 β defensins) were all
expressed in at least one sample or more (Table 1). Most of the
defensins except DEFA5, DEFB116, DEFB127, DEFB114, and
DEFB108B did not show correlations to or only showed weak
correlations to viral/bacterial loads in blood that were statistically
not signiﬁcant (Figure 1B). DEFA5 was positively correlated to
the blood load of inﬂuenza A H7N9 virus (r = 0.735, p < 0.05,
Spearman correlation), which also showed two peaks similar
to those of the virus (Figure 1A). But DEFA5 did not show
correlations to the bacterial load. Diﬀerent from DEFA5,
DEFB116 and DEFB127 were positively correlated to the
blood load of Acinetobacter baumannii (r = 0.881 and 0.810, p
< 0.05), both of which showed two peaks with one consistent
with the peak of Acinetobacter baumannii and another at Day
6 (Figure 1A). The peak at Day 6 may indicate latent bacterial
infection that was undetectable in blood, suggesting potentially
superior sensitivity of defensin-based diagnostics. DEFB114 and
DEFB108B showed negative correlations with Acinetobacter
baumannii (r = −0.731 and −0.786, p < 0.05, Spearman
correlation, Figures 1A,B).
Diagnostic Values of Defensins On an
Independent Pneumonia Cohort
On the independent validation dataset, we ﬁrst extracted the
expression proﬁles of defensins and associated genes and
conducted t-SNE for visualization. It is obvious that bacterial
and viral pneumonia patients separately formed clusters with a
few exceptions (Figure 2, left). Clustering analysis grouped the
patients into two classes, one of which corresponded to bacterial
pneumonia and the other corresponded to viral pneumonia
(Figure 2, middle). The accuracy of clustering analysis reached
82%, with 18 patients mis-clustered. Clustering based on the
raw high-dimensional data resulted in similar results, suggesting

Zhou et al.
Defensins Correlate to Bacterial/Viral Infection
that bacterial and viral infections caused diﬀerent responses
for defensins and associated genes in blood. When switching
the algorithms from unsupervised to supervised, high accuracy
(93%), AUC (0.97), sensitivity (0.98), speciﬁcity (0.82), precision
(0.90), and F1-score (0.94) were achieved by a random forest
classiﬁer with default parameters (Figure 2, right), suggesting
the potential of defensin-based diagnostics to discriminate
viral/bacterial infections.
Among the 87 defensins and associated genes that had
expression values available, DEFA4 and DEFA3 were the
most signiﬁcantly diﬀerentially expressing defensins between
bacterial and viral pneumonia patients. Both of these two
defensins are alpha defensins and highly expressed in viral
pneumonia patient blood (Figure 3, upper). The p-values tested
by Wilcoxin rand-sum test were 7.96 × 10−6 and 2.89 ×
10−6 for DEFA4 and DEFA3, respectively. DEFB107A was
signiﬁcantly highly expressed in bacterial pneumonia patient
blood (Figure 3, lower left, p = 0.0055, Wilcoxin rand-sum
test). MX1 is the most signiﬁcant defensin-associated gene
diﬀerentially expressed between bacterial and viral pneumonia
(Figure 3, lower right, p = 1.07 × 10−9, Wilcoxin rand-sum
test).
Evaluations on two additional datasets (GSE6269 and
GSE63990) conﬁrmed the diagnostic power of defensins
and associated genes (Figure 4). On the dataset GSE6269,
the accuracy can reach 95% while the AUC, sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, precision, and F1-score are 0.96, 1, 0.9, 0.92,
and 0.96, respectively. On the dataset GSE63990, similar
performance was obtained, with accuracy 89%, AUC 0.94,
sensitivity 0.84, speciﬁcity 0.93, precision 0.88 and F1-score
0.85.
DISCUSSION
Accurate discrimination of bacterial and viral infections has
important clinical values and can inform clinicians to properly
select therapies. Identifying biomarkers that can accurately
classify bacterial infections from viral infections is thus of
great importance. Blood-based assays including microarrays
and next-generation sequencing provide a quite convenient
method to quantify the expression levels of various genes,
which form a rich resource for determination of biomarkers
discriminating bacterial and viral infections. Multiple studies
have been completed to seek such biomarkers from human
blood gene expression proﬁles (Zaas et al., 2009; Parnell et al.,
2012; Hu et al., 2013, 2015; Suarez et al., 2015). However, the
values of defensins are often overlooked. Defensins, which are a
major family of antimicrobial peptides expressed predominantly
in neutrophils and epithelial cells and play important roles
in innate immune defense against infectious pathogens, are
hypothesized by us to action in distinct ways when combating
against bacterial and viral infections, and thus we conducted this
study.
We addressed the diagnostic values of defensins through two
ways. Firstly, we checked the associations between human blood
defensin mRNAs and the bacterial and viral loads through a
continuous follow-up of a pneumonia patient caused by infection
of inﬂuenza A H7N9 virus. This longitudinal study revealed
that bacterial and viral loads were associated to beta and alpha
defensins, respectively, among which several defensins showed
impressing statistical signiﬁcance. Secondly, we re-analyzed the
diagnostic values of defensins on an independent dataset, which
quantiﬁed blood gene expression proﬁles of 100 pneumonia
patients including 61 bacterial and 39 viral infections. This lateral
study demonstrated again the diagnostic power of defensins
for discriminating bacterial and viral infections. Both studies
remind that defensins and associated genes have great diagnostic
potentials which deserve further investigation in the future.
Although, the statistically signiﬁcant defensins in these two
studies did not overlap well, they could be caused or at least
explained by the diﬀerent study types and proﬁling techniques
(microarray-based or NGS-based). Further studies were needed
to exclude the technical interference and to include more
biological variance.
We also compared the defensin-based biomarkers with
published biomarker panels. We noticed that MX1 appeared
multiple times across the studies, consistent with its great
diﬀerence between bacterial and viral infections. Other defensins
and associated genes are reported for the ﬁrst time to have
diagnostic power to discriminate bacterial from viral infections,
and thus may provide new insights into the infection mechanisms
and serve as important tools for clinical diagnosis. Because innate
immunity is the ﬁrst frontier of host to combat pathogens, the
diﬀerences of defensins and associated genes during bacterial and
viral infections may suggest that prominent patterns exist in host
innate immune responses and defensins are valid representative
molecules.
In summary, defensins not only are important molecules for
hosts to combat infections, but also may provide promising
biomarkers to indicate the types of infectious agents, which
is expected to of signiﬁcant clinical utility and needs further
investigations.
