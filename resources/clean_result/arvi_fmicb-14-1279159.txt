Respiratory tract infections remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. The burden is further increased by polymicrobial infection or viral
and bacterial co-infection, often exacerbating the existing condition. Way back
in 1918, high morbidity due to secondary pneumonia caused by bacterial
infection was known, and a similar phenomenon was observed during the
recent COVID-19 pandemic in which secondary bacterial infection worsens
the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) condition.
It has been observed that viruses paved the way for subsequent bacterial
infection; similarly, bacteria have also been found to aid in viral infection.
Viruses elevate bacterial infection by impairing the host’s immune response,
disrupting epithelial barrier integrity, expression of surface receptors and adhesion
proteins, direct binding of virus to bacteria, altering nutritional immunity, and
effecting the bacterial bioﬁlm. Similarly, the bacteria enhance viral infection by
altering the host’s immune response, up-regulation of adhesion proteins, and
activation of viral proteins. During co-infection, respiratory bacterial and viral
pathogens were found to adapt and co-exist in the airways of their survival
and to beneﬁt from each other, i.e., there is a cooperative existence between
the two. This review comprehensively reviews the mechanisms involved in the
synergistic/cooperativity relationship between viruses and bacteria and their
interaction in clinically relevant respiratory infections.

1 Introduction
Respiratory tract infections are among the most prevalent human infections and
are a major health and economic burden worldwide. They include upper respiratory
tract infections (URTI) like pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, otitis media, and tonsillitis and
lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) like pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchitis, and
bronchiolitis (Dasaraju and Liu, 1996). World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that
4 million people die each year due to acute respiratory infections (ARI), out of which
the majority are infants, children, and geriatric patients (World Health Organization,
2020). In developed countries, it was estimated that respiratory infections account for

60% of antibiotic prescriptions (Lindbaek, 2006) and more than
30% of sick leave. The burden is much higher in developing
countries where respiratory infections accounted for the majority
of deaths in children below the age of 5 years (Bryce et al., 2005).
Both bacteria and viruses have been found to cause respiratory
infections in humans. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
aureus, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common

(Cappelletty, 1998; Burillo and Bouza, 2010; Gadsby et al., 2015).
Viral pathogens like Inﬂuenza A (IAV) and B, Respiratory Syncytial
Virus (RSV), Adenovirus, Parainﬂuenza viruses, and Human
Bocavirus account for 30–40% of respiratory infections (Huang
et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2019).
Recent technological advances have detected the presence of
both viruses and bacteria in diﬀerent respiratory diseases such as
pneumonia, otitis media (OM), cystic ﬁbrosis (CF), Coronavirus –
19 (COVID-19), etc. Research has suggested that high morbidity
during the 1918 pandemic may be due to secondary pneumonia
caused by bacterial infection (Morens et al., 2008). A similar
phenomenon was observed during the recent COVID-19 pandemic
in which secondary bacterial infection worsens the SARS-CoV-2
condition (Lansbury et al., 2020). De Bruyn et al. (2022) found
that 68% of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU developed
secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia, bacteremia, etc. In
a study conducted in Saudi Arabia, higher mortality rates were
observed in COVID-19 patients co-infected with bacteria (50%)
as compared to the SARS-CoV-2- only infected group (18.7%)
(Alqahtani et al., 2022). Diﬀerent studies have shown that there is
a symbiotic interaction between viruses and bacteria to establish
an infection. Bacteria have been found to aid viral infection by
altering the host’s immune response (Bellinghausen et al., 2016),
upregulating the surface adhesion proteins (Gulraiz et al., 2015), by
activation of viral proteins (Tashiro et al., 1987a,b), etc. Similarly,
viruses have been found to aid bacteria in establishing secondary
infection through several mechanisms, including impairment of
the host’s immune response (Ghoneim et al., 2013), disruption
of epithelial barrier integrity (Short et al., 2016), expression of
surface receptors and adhesion proteins (Avadhanula et al., 2006),
direct binding of virus to bacteria (Rowe et al., 2019), alteration
of nutritional immunity (Siegel et al., 2014), etc. For better
management of infectious diseases, it is essential to understand
the underlying mechanism by which bacteria and viruses interact
and aggregate, infect, or establish infection. This review provides
a comprehensive look into the mechanisms involved in viral and
bacterial co-infections and how this interaction played out in
diﬀerent respiratory infections in human.
2 Search strategy
The review was conducted through searches of the PubMed
database using diﬀerent search terms. The search term "viral
bacterial co-infection" yielded 3,289 results; the results were ﬁltered
to focus on co-infection in the respiratory tract and to eliminate
co-infections in other systems like urinary tract infections and
intestinal and gut infections. For the keyword "viral, bacterial coinfection," the number of published articles increased signiﬁcantly
from 84 papers in 2010 to 315 papers in 2022. Other speciﬁc
keywords were employed to study the co-infection patterns in
diﬀerent diseases. In total, 147 papers were reviewed in this study.
3 Interactions of bacteria and viruses
in human infections
Viruses and bacteria can interact directly or indirectly in
human infection, and interaction between these two could be either
positive or negative (Almand et al., 2017). Mutualism, symbiosis, or
aiding in the evasion of the host’s immune system are all examples
of positive associations. At the same time, negative interactions
occur through ammensalism, predation, or when the host immune
system aﬀects one organism over the other. The processes
driving the synergy between virus and bacteria are complicated
and multifaceted, with bacterial, viral, and host immunological
components contributing to increased predisposition of infection.
Many bacteria and viruses interact with each other and establish
successful respiratory infections (Table 1). The respiratory viruses
and bacterial interactions predispose bacterial superinfections,
resulting in severe illness, and these interactions can inﬂuence
microbial pathogenesis, including increased bacterial adhesion,
enhanced virion stability, and modulation of the immune response
by one microbe that beneﬁts the other (Håkansson et al., 1994;
El Ahmer et al., 1999). Similarly, bacterial infection has also
been found to modulate viral infections exacerbating the disease
(Verkaik et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2015).
3.1 Virus elevates bacteria invasion
It has been established that prior viral infection augmented
bacterial adherence to host cells. For example, it has been observed
that in children with acute otitis media, prior infection by
adenovirus type 1, 2, 3, and 5 signiﬁcantly enhances pneumococcal
colonization (Håkansson et al., 1994). Another study by El Ahmer
et al. (1999) also found that inﬂuenza A infection of Hep-2
cells increased the adherence of S. pneumonia, H. inﬂuenza, and
M. catarrhalis to virus-infected Hep-2 cells. Virus-induced bacterial
adherence is achieved through several mechanisms, which are
brieﬂy discussed in this section. The mechanisms are represented
and summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively.
(i) Impairment of the host’s immune response:
Respiratory viruses can disrupt the host’s immune system
through the malfunction and depletion of innate immune cells.
One of the most well-studied cases is the inﬂuenza virusinduced dysfunction and depletion of alveolar macrophages,
promoting subsequent bacterial infection (Ghoneim et al., 2013;
Short et al., 2016). RSV infection has been found to cause
neutrophil dysfunction by lowering oxidative burst and promoting
apoptosis of neutrophils, elevating the adherence of S. aureus
or P. aeruginosa (Stark et al., 2006). Inﬂuenza infection also
modiﬁes monocyte functions, inhibiting proper immune response
and reducing cytokine activity and synthesis, resulting in increased
bacterial colonization and mortality risk (Abramson et al., 1982).
Another innate immune cell aﬀected by viral infection is Natural
Killer (NK) cells, which are the critical components of the innate

Elevation of bacterial colonization by viral infection. (A) Virus infection decrease the mucociliary clearance action resulting in increased bacterial
colonization. (B) Viral infection impaired the epithelial barrier integrity by breaking Tight Junctions (TJs) and inhibiting Na+/K + ATPase pump
promoting bacterial entry to the host cells. (C) Viruses directly binds to bacterial surface proteins forming a viral-bacterial complex that can infect
uninfected cells as well as infected cells. (D) Viral proteins like Neuraminidase (NA) cleaves the sialic acid residues on the epithelial cell membrane
exposing surface receptors and adhesion proteins aiding bacterial colonization. (E) Viral infection promotes bacterial bioﬁlm formation and growth
by providing increased nutrients. (F) Viruses induced changes in host environment promotes dispersion of bacterial bioﬁlm leading to increased
translocation of more virulent bacteria to other sites. (G) Viral infection induce change in nutritional immunity of the host resulting in elevated levels
of nutrients which are utilized by bacteria for their growth. (H) Viral infection altered the host’s immune response to bacteria by decreasing the
production and function of important immune cells like macrophages, NK cells, Dendritic cells and Neutrophils.
immune response. Small et al. (2010) found that inﬂuenza infection
increased susceptibility to S. aureus by reducing TNF-α induced
NK cell production and impairing the activation of NK cells.
Viral infection also aﬀects the adaptive immune response like T
CD8 + and T CD4 + cell and antibody responses. RSV has been
found to facilitate reinfection by reducing immune memory. This
is achieved by impairing the interaction between dendritic cells
and T-cells, reducing activation of naïve antigen-speciﬁc T-cells
(González et al., 2008). In inﬂuenza-infected mice, a decrease in
the production of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3-L),
a dendritic cell diﬀerentiation factor was observed, resulting in
decreased dendritic cell population in the lungs contributing to
secondary bacterial infection (Beshara et al., 2018).
Depletion and dysfunction of innate and adaptive immune cells
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the production of cytokines and chemokines.
Inﬂuenza infection has been found to decrease the production
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,
decreasing bacterial clearance. Inﬂuenza infection has also been
found to aﬀect the adaptive Type 17 response. Nakamura
et al. (2011) found that inﬂuenza inhibited the production of
chemokine CCL2 responsible for bacterial clearance through the
enhanced expression of type I IFN, thus promoting pneumococcal
colonization. Robinson et al. (2013) also found that Inﬂuenza
infection exacerbates S. aureus infection by decreasing IL-1β
production, which attenuates Type 17 immunity. Lastly, Kudva
et al. (2011) found that in mice infected with inﬂuenza virus and
Staphylococcus aureus, a signiﬁcant decrease in production of IL17 and IL-22 cytokines was observed. Interestingly, cytokine release
during the acute inﬂammation stage has been found to be capable of
enhancing the growth of bacteria and prolonging bacterial infection
(dos Santos et al., 2002). Kanangat et al. (1999) and Meduri et al.
(1999) found that high concentrations of cytokines like IL-1b, IL6, and TNF-α enhance the in vitro growth of bacteria, including
S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and Actinobacteria sp.
(ii) Disruption of epithelial barrier integrity
Viral infection has been found to cause extensive damage to the
human epithelial and endothelial cells. Epithelial barrier damage
may occur due to direct cleavage of tight junctions. Downregulation
of junction proteins through the host’s pro-inﬂammatory response
against the virus results in impaired barrier integrity, increased
