Background: Published evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is conﬂicting. Most studies suggest an increase
in the severity of OCD in people with pre-existing OCD, whereas some do not.
Aim: Given the conﬂicting evidence globally and lack of data from the Arab world, we
aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in
adults with pre-existing OCD.
Methods: A telephonic questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among adults with
pre-existing OCD and speciﬁcally with fear of contamination and washing compulsions
being major symptom dimensions of OCD. The severity of OCD during the pandemic was
compared with their pre-pandemic scores. The severity of OCD was assessed using the
Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS).
Results: Those with the duration of diagnosis of OCD of <10 years showed a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the mean YBOCS score of 5.54 from pre-pandemic to during
pandemic, which was signiﬁcant at p = 0.006. This signiﬁcance was maintained across
the Compulsive and Obsessive subsets of the scale.
Conclusion:
Adults with pre-existing OCD with fear of contamination reported a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms only if
the duration of their OCD diagnosis was relatively shorter (<10 years). In the context
of the conﬂicting evidence regarding the worsening of OCD symptoms due to the unique
infection control measures of this pandemic, this study highlights the importance of the
impact of the duration of the disorder and the subtype of the disorder. Such classiﬁcation
might help public health resources to be directed better at those most at risk and also
help us understand the very nature of this disorder better.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus Disease 2019 was declared as a public health
emergency by the WHO in March 2020 (1). This public
health emergency prompted large-scale lockdown to limit the
spread of infection and various public health measures were
implemented including frequent handwashing, use of face masks,
social distancing, and quarantining of infected individuals
(2, 3). Infectious epidemics are associated with an increased
level of anxiety and stress in the healthy population and
worsen symptoms among individuals with pre-existing mental
disorders (4, 5). The vulnerability of individuals with preexisting mental disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak has
been widely reported in scientiﬁc publications and ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder (OCD) is particularly relevant because of
the widespread fear of contamination and ritualized cleaning
behavior advocated to limit the spread of infection (6–8). Similar
ﬁndings have been reported from previous outbreaks such as
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and novel inﬂuenza
(H1N1), where obsessive-compulsive symptoms worsened due
to fears of acquiring infection (9, 10). In the current pandemic,
some commentators have considered patients with OCD to
be particularly vulnerable, especially patients with obsessions
around contamination (11). It was thus speculated at the start of
the pandemic that the OCD symptoms will increase during the
pandemic. However, the published evidence about the impact of
the pandemic on OCD so far is conﬂicting. Multiple studies in
nonclinical samples have reported an increase in OCD symptoms
(12–14). Most of the studies suggest an increase in OCD in people
with manifest OCD during the pandemic (15–19). Whereas some
do not (20).
In an online survey conducted in November 2020 in Germany,
it was found that the majority of participants with OCD were
negatively aﬀected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative
eﬀects were more pronounced in people with hand washing
compulsions. A total of 72% of the participants reported an
increase in OCD. This increase was signiﬁcantly stronger in
washers (15, 21). Ji G et al. conducted a prospective cohort
survey study in China (21). It examined if fear of negative events
aﬀects Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores
in the context of a COVID-19–fear-invoking environment. It was
concluded that the ﬁndings indicate that the fear of COVID-19
was associated with a greater Y-BOCS score, suggesting that an
environment (COVID-19 pandemic) × psychology (fear and/or
anxiety) interaction might be involved in OCD and that fear of
negative events might play a role in the etiology of OCD. Data
from Italy in July 2020 supports the notion of the exacerbation
of OCD symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as about
one-third of their sample reported clinical worsening of OCD
(16, 17).
Tanir et al. (18) looked at a sample of children and adolescents
with a primary diagnosis of OCD in a university hospital
(18). They report a signiﬁcant increase in the frequency of
contamination obsessions and cleaning/washing compulsions
during the pandemic period with a signiﬁcant relationship
with talking/searching in the social environment about COVID19, daily preoccupation about COVID-19, duration of OCD
diagnosis, and diagnosis of COVID-19 in someone familiar.
Nissen et al. (19) explored the immediate eﬀect of the COVID-19
pandemic on two groups of children and adolescents, one newly
diagnosed with OCD and the other, who was diagnosed years
ago and their primary treatment was completed. They report
worsening of symptoms in both groups but more pronounced in
the group who were diagnosed years ago (19).
Chakraborty and Karmakar 2020 did not ﬁnd any increase
in obsessive and compulsive symptoms in patients with an
obsession with contamination and compulsive washing before
the pandemic. This study conducted in India report a very
small proportion of patients (6%) experiencing symptoms of
exacerbation (20).
There are limited studies looking at the impact of the
pandemic on OCD in the Arab world. Khan et al. explored the
association of pandemic with obsessive-compulsive symptoms
in adolescents with preexisting mental and behavioral disorders
in Qatar and reports signiﬁcant pandemic fears associated with
obsessive-compulsive symptoms (22).
Given the conﬂicting evidence globally and limited data from
the Arab world, we aimed to explore the impact of pandemic fears
on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in adults with pre-existing
OCD in Qatar. Qatar is a peninsula in the Arabian Gulf, with
a population of ∼2.7 million, of which ∼75% are men, and
operates a publicly funded healthcare system (23).
METHODS
Design, Settings, and Participants
This was a cross-sectional, single-center, exploratory study
conducted within the adult mental health service, Hamad
Medical Corporation, Qatar. The patients with a pre-existing
primary diagnosis of OCD (with fear of contamination and
washing compulsions being major symptom dimensions of
OCD) were included in the study. The list of participants
was obtained through a system-generated search based on the
diagnostic code of OCD, which generated a sample of 300
patients registered with adult mental health services. In total, 36
patients out of 300 were identiﬁed to have fear of contamination
and washing compulsions as a major symptom dimension of their
OCD by reviewing their clinical information and thus deemed
eligible for the study. At the time of the data collection, in January
2021, the State of Qatar was under a strict lockdown at that time
with strict measures to contain the spread of infection. There
were restrictions of gatherings, schools were closed, and it was
encouraged to work from home.
Inclusion Criteria
All adult patients aged 18–65 with a pre-existing primary
diagnosis of OCD with fear of contamination and washing
compulsions being major symptom dimensions of OCD and
agreed to participate were eligible.
Exclusion Criteria
Inability to consent for participation in the study due to
underlying mental or physical health conditions or inability to
engage with the interview.

All eligible patients consented to participate, and all were
selected as the number was small. The study design was
exploratory, we did not set and formulate any prior statistical
hypothesis and, therefore, we did not perform any formal sample
size calculation.
Measures
The survey questionnaire included two sections. The ﬁrst section
was designed to collect data on demographic characteristics
(age, gender, and ethnicity) and information regarding the
duration of OCD, psychiatric co-morbidity, current medication,
and mitigating factors. The second section assessed the severity
of OCD symptoms using the Y-BOCS (24–27). The survey
questionnaires were in English and Arabic, and the validated
Arabic translation was used. The initial draft of the composite
data collection tool was piloted on ﬁve participants by two
researchers to assess the feasibility of the data collection tool.
Modiﬁcations were made to the data collection tool to account for

missing or unclear information and a ﬁnal version was approved
after discussion with the wider team. To achieve maximum
reliability among the raters, a training session about the rating
methods and terms was carried out.
The Y-BOCS is the gold standard to evaluate the severity of
OCD symptoms. It is the most widely used semi-structural scale
in both clinical and research settings. Y-BOCS is a validated and
established self-administered tool combining self-reported and
clinician-rated questions. The Y-BOCS is sensitive to change and
hence helps to determine improvements or exacerbation of the
disorder symptomatology. Studies of the Y-BOCS have shown
that it has adequate psychometric characteristics, including good
interrater reliability and predictive validity (28). It consists of a

comprehensive symptom checklist to identify the speciﬁc type
and content of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in addition
to a 10-item rating scale. The scale is divided into two subscales
that separately measure obsessions and compulsions. For each
subscale, ﬁve aspects of obsessive and compulsive pathology
are each rated on a scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 4
(extreme symptoms): time spent, degree of interference, distress,
resistance (greater resistance is assigned lower scores), and
perceived control over the symptom. Subscale scores are summed
to yield a Y-BOCS total score. A total score of 0–7 is considered
nonclinical. Scores ranging between 8 and 15 are considered
mild. Scores between 16 and 23 are considered moderate and
scores between 24–31 and 32–40 are considered severe and
extreme, respectively. These instruments were administered by
healthcare professionals, proﬁcient in both English and Arabic
languages comprising two psychiatry trainees. Both trainees were
proﬁcient in administering the tools. Interviews were carried out
in the month of January 2021, and the data was collected for
this study.
Ethical Considerations
The study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Research
Center (MRC-01-20-105) and the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) at Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar. Phone calls
were made to all participants included in the sample to invite
them to the study. Consent of the participating individuals
was obtained verbally over the phone and recorded. All
information relevant to the study including its purpose,
impact
on
clinical
care,
and
conﬁdentiality
safeguards
were provided.
The Strategy of Data Analysis
All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS R⃝Statistics version
26 (IBM, NY, USA).
Paired Sample t-test was used to compare the means
from
the
same
group
at
diﬀerent
times.
This
test
helped us to know how signiﬁcant the diﬀerences were
between the groups.
Pearson correlation test was used to determine the linear
correlation between the two sets of data (pre-pandemic
and pandemic).
Mann Whitney U test was used to compare diﬀerences
between two independent groups when the dependent variable
is either continuous or ordinal but not normally distributed.
Diﬀerences in Obsessions, compulsions, and total YBOCS
scores during pre-pandemic and pandemic times were measures.
RESULTS
Socio-Demographic Characteristics
Of these 36 patients, about 70% were females compared to
30% males which are in line with the global prevalence of
this illness. Qataris constituted 30% of the sample although
they represent only around 10% of the population (23). N
= 15 (41.7%) had a duration of the diagnosis of OCD for
over 10 years. N = 13 (36%) of the individuals had a comorbid psychiatric illness, of which the majority, N = 10
had depression. Majority, N = 30 were maintained on antdepressants and only N = 6 individuals were on anti-psychotics
(Table 1).
Differences Between the Scores of
Patients With OCD Before and During
COVID-19
The mean YBOCS before the pandemic was 15.6 (SD 9.4) and the
mean YBOCS during the pandemic was 18.08 (SD 10.6), with no
signiﬁcant statistical diﬀerence for the group as a whole (p = 0.11,
2-tailed paired t-test) (Table 2).
The mean YBOCS before the pandemic for the Obsessions
scale was 8.03 (SD 4.84) and the mean YBOCS during the
pandemic was 9.42 (SD 5.5), with no signiﬁcant statistical
diﬀerence for the group as a whole (p = 0.13, 2-tailed paired
t-test) (Table 2).
The mean YBOC before the pandemic for the Compulsions
scale was 7.61 (SD 5.9) and the mean YBOCS during the
pandemic was 8.67 (SD 5.6), with no signiﬁcant statistical
diﬀerence for the group as a whole (p = 0.20, 2-tailed paired
t-test) (Table 2).
There were no signiﬁcant correlations between changes in YBOCS scores and socio-demographic variables. Those with the
duration of diagnosis of OCD of <10 years, N = 21, showed a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in the mean YBOCS score of 5.54
from pre-pandemic to during pandemic, which was signiﬁcant at
p = 0.006, Tables 3, 4.
This
diﬀerence
was
maintained
even
for
individual
components of the Y-BOCS scale for this group. The Obsessions
and the Compulsions subscales of the Y-BOCS showed a
signiﬁcant change in scores of 0.02 and 0.004 respectively,
Tables 3, 4.
DISCUSSION
This

of

symptoms
in
patients
with
pre-existing

diagnoses
and speciﬁcally with fear of contamination in the state

The
main
ﬁnding
of
this
study
is
that
there
was
worsening
of
OCD symptoms for individuals with a relatively shorter
duration of existing OCD diagnosis (<10 years) during
the

pandemic
compared
to
pre-pandemic
symptom severity.
Published evidence so far has largely looked at the impact of
COVID-19 on OCD in general, rather than focusing speciﬁcally
on OCD with contamination fears or with the duration of
the OCD. We set out to study this subset of the aﬀected
population as the main strategy for the control of the pandemic
has been an emphasis on the prevention of the spread of
infection by avoiding close contact and ritualistic hand hygiene
measures (20). While a necessary measure, it has resulted in
an increase in fears of contamination in the general public
and vulnerable populations triggering obsessive-compulsive type
symptoms fuelled by fears of contamination (21, 22). Two
of the four main symptom domains of OCD are the fear of

contamination and washing rituals (29). Amongst the diverse
symptom dimensions of OCD, the most frequently recurring
themes are obsessions related to contamination (29). There is
a growing evidence base that emphasizes the importance of
symptom subtypes of OCD in relation to its course, treatment
response, and prognosis (30–32). This study was therefore
careful in selecting only those participants whose obsessions
and compulsions were directly linked to the infection control
measures of COVID-19.
We
hypothesize
that
those
with
a
long
duration
of
OCD
symptoms
were
not
signiﬁcantly
aﬀected
by
the
COVID-19 infection control measures due to the stability
of
their
symptoms
and
presumably
wider
exposure
to
varying situations. This has an important public health
implication of directing extra help and support for those
with shorter duration and newly diagnosed OCD. Identifying
people at risk of worsening OCD and other mental health
problems during this or any future pandemics is important
to help formulate informed utilization of limited public
health resources. This is in line with the World Health
Organization’s Policy Brief: COVID-19 and the Need for
Action on Mental Health and other global mental health
organizations (33).
It is important to note that our data was collected
in January 2021, and there is evidence the increase in
mental
distress
that
occurred
during
the
emergence
of
COVID-19
largely
diminished
in
the
months
to
follow
due
to
the
population-level
resilience
in
mental
health (34). It is possible that as the duration and the
nature of the pandemic evolves, these subset diﬀerences
might disappear.
Given the conﬂicting evidence arising from the reported
studies so far, this study, although exploratory, highlights
important
caveats
that
future
studies
should
keep
in
mind
before
carrying
out
population-based
studies
on
COVID-19
in
this
pandemic.
Future
studies
should
consider the subtypes of OCD and also the duration of
the diagnosis of OCD. Further, as this pandemic evolves,
prospective
longer-term
studies
will
help
us
understand
not just the impact of this pandemic on this disorder
but will possibly also shed some light on the nature of the
disorder itself.
Limitations
The study design was exploratory, we did not set and
formulate
any
prior
statistical
hypothesis
and
did
not
have
a
control
group.
There
is
a
range
of
potential
mechanisms by which COVID-19 could impact OCD and
cohort studies are necessary to determine the incidence,
etiology,
and
prognosis
of
COVID-19-associated
OCD.

Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common behavioral disorder 
among adolescents and children. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are 
the first pharmacological choice for this condition due to mild adverse effect profile.
Objective: This systematic review was performed to evaluate the efficacy of SSRI for 
OCD in adolescents and children.
Methods: Search terms were entered into PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, and 
Google Scholar. The included studies were randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 
SSRIs conducted in populations of children and adolescents younger than 18 years. 
Change from baseline Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), 
end-treatment CY-BOCS with respective SD, and response and remission rates were 
collected for continuous and dichotomous outcome assessment, respectively. Cochrane 
Rev Man software was used for meta-analyses, providing Forest plots where applicable.
Results: SSRIs were superior to placebo with a small effect size. There was no additional 
benefit of combination treatment over cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone, but CBT 
added substantial benefit to SSRI monotherapy. Fluoxetine and sertraline appear to be 
superior to fluvoxamine.
Conclusion: The results of current systematic review and meta-analysis support the 
existing National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for choosing 
CBT as first line of treatment and substituting it with SSRI, depending on patient 
SSRI for Treatment of OCD in Adolescents and Children

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic debilitating 
condition that is associated with recurrent and persistent thoughts 
and the compulsions to suppress them with certain excessive 
and repetitive behaviors. For about half of the diagnosed cases, 
the onset of OCD takes place in childhood or adolescence (1). 
Compared with adults, children are more likely to demonstrate 
the evolution of clinical manifestations and the symptoms wax 
and wane as they grow (2, 3).
Currently, the diagnosis is based on internationally accepted 
classification systems, namely Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders in its fifth edition (DSM 5) in the United 
States and, less frequently, ICD 10 criteria elsewhere. In addition 
to diagnosing, the severity of the condition is assessed and 
documented using validated scales, such as Children’s YaleBrown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) for children and 
adolescents, which is a modification of the original Yale-Brown 
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) used for adults.
Medications and psychotherapy or a combination of both are 
commonly used to treat patients with OCD. The only currently 
available treatment options for OCD are either medication 
or psychotherapy or the combination thereof (4, 5), the latter 
being chosen for more severe, refractory to treatment and 
comorbid cases.
Treatment with clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant 
(TCA) that inhibits reuptake of serotonin, was the first option 
demonstrated to be effective at reducing OCD symptoms (6), 
and this was later confirmed in a 2003 meta-analysis (7) for the 
pediatric population. Although clomipramine is an effective 
option, it cannot be used as a first-line agent for treating OCD in 
children and adolescents due to its overburdened adverse effect 
profile (8, 9). Although it most commonly causes a combination 
of minor cholinergic symptoms, such as sedation, bothersome 
xerostomia, constipation, and urinary retention, and even 
more, severe events like seizures and cardiovascular effects, 
such as orthostatic hypotension, tachy- and bradyarrhythmias, 
ventricular fibrillation, and prolonged QT are well documented. 
In some of the devastating cases, sudden cardiac death in youth 
is attributed to such effects. Thus, a better tolerated and safer 
alternative has been sought to replace clomipramine as the more 
appropriate pharmaceutical candidate. The selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) seem to efficiently fill in that role.
Approved by the FDA at the end of 1978, fluoxetine (Prozac) 
was the first agent marketed as an SSRI, and its use has once and 
for all established the role of serotonin (5-HT) in the pathogenesis 
of psychiatric disorders. SSRIs were in many aspects’ superior 
to the pre-existing classes of anti-depressants, i.e., TCAs and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Being selective in 
nature of their action, SSRIs had a much more favorable sideeffect profile (especially regarding that of arrhythmias and QT 
prolongation which were absent with the latter agents), easier 
dose titration, remarkable margin of safety when considering 
overdoses, and thus overall were better tolerated and adhered to 
by the populations with psychiatric and mood disorders (10).
A meta-analysis suggested clomipramine to be more effective 
compared with SSRI for the treatment of OCD in children (11). 
That said, direct comparisons of clomipramine and SSRI have 
not shown any superiority for any of the two drugs for treating 
OCD in adults (12–15). There has not been a single study 
comparing clomipramine to SSRI in a head to head design for 
treating OCD in children, and the claims of the former being 
more efficacious than the latter cannot be given considerable 
weight until proven otherwise.
The commonly held opinion is that cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) should be the first line of treatment for OCD in 
children and adolescents. This approach has also been endorsed 
by the existing clinical guidelines (16, 17) and has a considerable 
base of evidence. A systematic review of 13 randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) assessing the treatment options for OCD (18) 
pointed out to the place and efficacy of CBT for the management 
of OCD in children and adolescents, but the comparisons were 
made to waitlist and placebo treatment, and not to other available 
active options.
Thus, the current role of SSRIs in managing OCD in 
adolescents and children remains at least under-investigated. 
We have undertaken this review to address some of the gaps 
concerning SSRI treatment, as described more thoroughly below.
To be familiar with the ground of research on OCD treatment, 
the reader is humbly referred to the previously conducted 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerning the abovementioned issues (7, 11, 19–23).
THE RATIONALE FOR THIS REVIEW
The current systematic review was undertaken for the following 
reasons. There have been a number of both remote and recent 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses on various treatment 
options for OCD in adolescents and children (see above), 
including CBT, SRI, and the combination thereof, but none 
has specifically addressed the role of SSRIs, and comparisons 
between different SSRIs are lacking as well. Thus, we have decided 
to review the existing literature regarding treatments that utilize 
preference. Adding CBT to current SSRI treatment is effective for non-responders and 
partial responders, but adding SSRI to ongoing CBT does not prove beneficial. The SSRIs 
have different effectiveness, and their relative efficacy remains to be investigated.

only SSRIs as the medication of intervention for treatment of 
OCD in adolescents and children.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The purpose of the current systematic review and meta-analysis 
was to investigate the efficacy of SSRIs in forms of monotherapy 
or in combination treatment with CBT for the management of 
OCD in adolescents and children and compare the effectiveness 
of different SSRIs.
METHODS
Search for Publications
The authors (AK and VK) searched the PubMed, PsycINFO, 
Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases using the 
following keywords: (“treatment” OR “therapy” OR “SSRI” OR 
“Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors” OR “sertraline” or 
“fluoxetine” OR “fluvoxamine “ OR “paroxetine” OR “citalopram” 
OR “escitalopram”) AND (“OCD” OR “obsessive compulsive 
disorder” OR “obsessional compulsive disorder”) AND (“children” 
OR “adolescents”), for citations from first available index date to 
January 1, 2018. The authors also manually searched the references 
from relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses for additional 
citations that could have been missed through the initial search.
Two authors (AK and SD) then independently screened the 
titles and abstracts for the exclusion of irrelevant studies. The full 
papers were then obtained to verify for inclusion eligibility. At 
each step, the results were compared between the researchers and 
any discrepancies were handled with means of discussion. Any 
disagreements were resolved by involving the third independent 
author (RA).
Eligibility for Inclusion
The studies were included if they successfully fulfilled any of the 
following criteria:
1.	 Participants were 18 years or younger
2.	 Participants had a primary diagnosis of OCD
3.	 SSRIs, such as escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, 
sertraline, vilazodone, and citalopram, were used
4.	 OCD symptom severity was reported via appropriate 
psychometric scale, i.e., CY-BOCS
5.	 RCTs
6.	 Studies published in English
Data Synthesis
Change from baseline CY-BOCS, end-treatment CY-BOCS, 
and remission and response rates was compared for different 
interventions arms. Cochrane’s Review Manager software was used 
to perform effect size calculations via random effects model, and 
standard mean differences (SMDs) were presented for continuous 
and in odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes, respectively. 
Forest plots and corresponding mean differences were presented in 
the figures and tables, where appropriate. A subgroup comparison 
was attempted for different SSRIs using the I2 statistic in generic 
inverse variance analysis.
RESULTS
Search Results
The search of databases produced 3,429 results. Following the 
exclusion of duplicates, another 2,241 studies were excluded 
during the title and abstract screening. This resulted in 136 
articles, the full paper texts of which were retrieved and reviewed. 
The search through citations did not reveal any additional relevant 
sources. Twelve articles, which met the inclusion criteria, were 
eventually included (Figure 1).
Characteristics of Included Studies
We have included 12 RCTs (published from 1992 to 2015) in our 
systematic review with a total number of 958 patients. Patients’ 
age ranged from 6 to 18 years with reported means ranging 
from 11 ± 3 to 15 ± 2.4 years. Two studies (18, 24) implemented 
Independent Medical Examination (IME), and seven studies 
used intention to treat (ITT) analysis. Only three studies (25–27) 
did not proceed with the ITT method due to high rate of trial 
completion (92.9%, 100%, and 97.5%, respectively). The pre-trial 
treatment of participants was markedly heterogeneous, wherever 
reported. One of the trials was of a crossover design (25), and 
only data extracted from initial 8 weeks were included in this 
review (the second phase had marked dropout rates). One study 
(28) directly (without a placebo arm) compared the two SSRIs 
(fluoxetine versus citalopram), and the extracted data were only 
used for evaluating the efficacy of different SSRIs.
All included studies reported primary outcome measures using 
CY-BOCS or calculations based on it. Ten studies reported rates 
of response to treatment, the definition of which varied across 
studies: 4, 2, and 1 studies defined response as 25%, 30%, and 40% 
decrease from baseline CY-BOCS, respectively, one study used endtreatment CY-BOCS ≤16 as a definition, and in only one report 
(29) the authors did not specify their definition albeit reported a 
rate. The rationale for combining such heterogenous dichotomous 
outcomes in a meta-analysis was that patients qualifying for a 
larger percent reduction (e.g., 40%) also simultaneously qualify 
for lesser percent reductions (e.g., 25% or 30%); thus one could 
be considering all “responding” patients to at least qualify for the 
least reported percent reduction. Three studies reported rates for 
CY-BOCS ≤11, which was defined as remission in all three. One 
study (26) did not specifically report the above-mentioned rates, 
but the raw data were included in the published article, which 
allowed appropriate calculations to be made.
Altogether 39.5% of patients involved in the 12 RCTs 
responded to all forms of treatment (intervention and placebo) 
as defined by the variety of numerical cutoffs (25%, 30%, and 
40% CY-BOCS reduction, CY-BOCS ≤16 and not otherwise 
specified), and 6.4% were considered to have achieved remission 
(as defined by CY-BOCS ≤11). The characteristics of included 
studies and their participants are presented in further detail in 
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Table 3 presents the risk of bias 
assessments across all included studies.

Since the meta-analyses performed in this review included less 
than 10 studies (see SSRI vs. placebo, N = 7) and were constructed 
on random effects model, funnel plots, and trim and fill analyses 
[see Refs. (34, 35)] would not be useful to assess publication bias. 
Instead, the file drawer phenomenon was recognized, and the 
possibility of publication bias was tested via Orwin’s fail-safe N 
formula [see below and Ref. (36)].

Because the only meta-analysis performed in this review that 
utilizes change from baseline for comparison was that for SSRI 
vs. placebo, the decision was made to calculate Nfs only with 
data from that analysis. The other analyses in this review used 
end-treatment scores for comparison, which by far is not the 
most appropriate manner of demonstrating effect size and is not 
recommended by Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews 
of Interventions (version 5.1.0).
However, the following values were inserted into the formula 
above: N0 = 7, d0 = −0.43, dc = 0.2 (since the effect size of the 
analysis, by the rule of thumb, was designated as small), and 
dfs = 0.
The calculation followed that Nfs = 8 studies with reported 
CY-BOCS standardized mean difference of 0.2 (small effect size, 
opposite direction) were required to bring the current SMD from 
−0.43 to 0.
COMPARISONS
Monotherapy With SSRI Versus Placebo
There were seven RCTs comparing SSRIs with placebo treatment 
included in our review. One of them (25) was conducted in a 
crossover fashion and only data from the first phase (first 8 
weeks) of the study were extracted and analyzed. The reason for 
this decision was that after the crossover, 50% of initially enrolled 
patients dropped out for reasons such as recurrence of symptoms 
after switching to placebo, and the sample size became too small. 
For similar reasons and also to yield homogenous treatment 
durations only data from the “acute phase” (i.e., the first 8 weeks) 
of another study (29) were incorporated into our analysis (the 
study also presented data from a later “maintenance phase,” 
which lasted for another 8 weeks and was performed with only 
participants who were responders). Another study (4) compared 
four intervention arms (SSRI, CBT, SSRI + CBT, placebo), 
from which we included the data for SSRI and placebo into our 
analysis. Overall, we analyzed data on a total number of 725 
patients, 51.6% and 48.4% of which received SSRI and placebo, 
respectively. All studies except one (4) either reported data on 
mean and SD of change from baseline CY-BOCS or presented 
other valuable data (t, p, baseline, end-treatment scores), and 
the change and SD were calculated in the following manner: the 
available values were entered into Rev Man Software’s built-in 
calculator, which returned the desirable measures. The mean 
differences and their pooled analysis are shown in Table 4.

The studies demonstrated effect sizes (SMD) ranging from small 
(−0.28, 95% CI, −0.9 to 0.3) to moderate (−0.75; 95% CI, −1.9 to 
0.4), and the pooled analysis achieved a small effect size of −0.43 
(95% CI, −0.6 to −0.3), which was significant (see Figure  2), 
favoring SSRI. The subgroup analysis did not demonstrate any 
difference between different SSRIs. The subgroups of sertraline, 
fluoxetine, and other SSRIs (paroxetine and fluvoxamine) all 
achieved similar small pooled effect sizes of −0.45 (95% CI, −0.73 
to −0.21), −0.45 (95% CI, −0.78 to −0.12), and −0.40 (95% CI, 
−0.62 to −0.18), respectively, which did not differ significantly 
(Chi2 = 0.18, df = 2 (P = 0.91), I2 = 0%).
Five studies also reported response rates, and one study 
reported remission rates based on various definitions (see above 
and Table 5). The pooled ln OR for response rate was 0.8 (95% 
CI, 0.5–1.1), which converts to SMD of 0.5, 95% CI 0.2, 0.8, p < 
0.05 (37) yielding a significant moderate effect size and favoring 
SSRI (37).
Monotherapy With SSRI Versus CBT
We have identified three RCTs comparing these two treatment 
modalities, all utilizing sertraline. In one study where the author’s 
randomized patients to either SSRI or CBT (18), all patients 
were pre-treated with CBT for 13 weeks before randomization, 
and thus switching to SSRI was compared to continued CBT 
over 16 weeks duration. Another study compared group CBT 
(GCBT) and SSRI treatment during 12 weeks (27). The third 
study (4), as mentioned above, separately compared three 
intervention arms with placebo. Data extracted from the SSRI 
and CBT arms were used for comparison. The SDs of change 
from baseline were not available for all three studies; thus,

scores. The two studies (4, 27) showed a mean difference of 
2.5 (95% CI, –1.96 to 6.96) and 2.5 (95% CI, –2.37 to 7.37) 
in favor of CBT with small effect sizes: SMD = 0.34 (95% CI, 
–0.28 to 0.97) and 0.27 (95% CI, –0.26 to 0.79), respectively, 
which were not significant. The study by Skarphedinsson et al.

compared with regard to their response and remission rates 
(see Table 6). Asbahr et al. and Skarphedinsson et al. reported 
response rates as defined by 25% and 30% reductions from 
baseline CY-BOCS scores, respectively (18, 27). The ln OR for 
the two studies were –0.7 (95% CI, –3.2 to 1.7) and 0.4 (95% CI 
–0.7 to 1.5), respectively. The combined ln OR was 0.2 (95% CI, 
–0.8 to 1.2), weakly favoring SSRI. Skarphedinsson et al. and 
POTS presented remission rates of ln OR = –0.2 (95% CI, –1.5 
to 1.0; and –0.9 (95% CI, −2.0 to 0.3); respectively, as defined 
by end-treatment CY-BOCS ≤11 (4, 18). The combined ln OR 
was −0.6 (95% CI, −1.4 to 0.3), which weakly favors CBT. Both 
comparisons were statistically non-significant (P > 0.05).
Combined Therapy With SSRI and CBT 
Versus Placebo
From studies included in our review, only one study (4) undertook 
a comparison of combination treatment versus placebo. The SD 
values of change from baseline could not be extracted from the 
paper or retrieved otherwise. Thus, only the end-treatment mean 
CY-BOCS could be compared.
The combination treatment and placebo arms yielded scores 
of 11.2 (SD = 8.6) and 21.5 (SD = 5.4), respectively, and the mean 
difference (MD) of these scores demonstrated the combination 
to be significantly superior (MD = −10.3, 95% CI, −14.1 to −6.5) 
compared with placebo (SMD = −1.41, 95% CI, −2.0 to −0.82). 
The paper also provided data regarding remission rates as defined 
by achieved CY-BOCS ≤11 with odds ratio of 31.1 (ln OR = 3.4; 
95% CI, 1.3–5.6) and 50% risk difference, which were statistically 
significant (P < 0.05).
Combined Therapy With SSRI and CBT 
Versus CBT Alone
Only two studies (4, 24) presented outcomes for comparing SSRI 
and CBT combination and CBT monotherapy. Both studies used 
sertraline as the intervention medication and reported outcomes as 
end-treatment CY-BOCS scores. In the study by Storch et al., CBT 
was combined with placebo, and not used as actual monotherapy 
(24). The study involved two arms: one with regular dosing and the 
other with titrated dosing. The titration arm was used to compare 
to the POTS study, which only used the dose titration approach.
In the study by Storch et al., a mean difference of −0.2 
(95%  C,: −6.2 to 5.8) was observed between the regular and 
CBT + placebo arms with an effect size of −0.02, 95% CI: −0.74, 
0.69 (24). The titration arm showed MD = 1.6; (95% CI, −3.3 
to 6.5; SMD, −0.2; 95% CI, −0.5 to 0.9). Both findings were 
non-significant. The POTS study achieved a mean difference of 
−2.8 (95% CI, −7.6 to 2.0), which was of small effect size, albeit 
insignificant (SMD = −0.3, 95% CI, −0.83 to 0.22) (4). A pooled 
analysis of the data from POTS and titration arm of Storch et 
al., utilizing the random effects model (as the Storch et al. study 
did not actually use CBT monotherapy but CBT + placebo) 
achieved a mean difference of −0.6 (95% CI, −4.9, 3.7) and effect 
size of −0.1 (95% CI, −0.6, 0.4, thus demonstrating no significant 
difference (4, 24).
Combined Therapy With SSRI and CBT 
Versus SSRI Alone
Two studies (4, 26) compared the combination of SSRI and 
CBT with SSRI monotherapy. Both reported end-treatment 
CY-BOCS data. The study by Neziroglu et al. specifically 
compared the combination treatment with monotherapy in a 
population that has previously failed CBT monotherapy (26). 
The authors evaluated the benefit of adding CBT on SSRI 
treatment regimen. Raw data were available and included the 
end-treatment CY-BOCS for baseline, 10, 43, and 52 weeks, 
and at 2 years follow-up, and change scores. To encompass 
homogenous treatment durations the comparison was made 
using data from the 52nd week. A mean difference of −5.4 
(95% CI, −11.3, 0.5 was observed with a significant, large effect 
size of SMD, −1.0, (95% CI: −2.4 to 0.4). The POTS study 
yielded a mean difference of −5.3, 95% CI: −10.0, −0.7 with 
a moderate effect size of −0.6, 95% CI: −1.1, −0.1, which was 
significant (4). The pooled analysis of data from both studies 
comprising a total of 66 patients achieved a mean difference 
of −5.3 (95% CI, −9.0 to −1.7), which was significant and of 
moderate effect size (SMD = −0.7, 95% CI: −1.1, −0.2), thus 
favoring the combination treatment.
Comparison of SSRI Versus No SSRI 
Intervention Arms
Considering placebo to be not an “actual intervention,” it was 
suggested that a comparison could be made between treatment 
arms that did or did not use SSRI. Four studies suitable for 
such analysis were reported [Refs. (4, 18, 24, 27)]. All four used 
sertraline as the SSRI of intervention. Three compared SSRI and 
CBT monotherapies, and two compared the combination of 
SSRI and CBT with CBT monotherapy (see Table 7). A pooled 
analysis of the mean differences using generic inverse variance 
and random effects analysis model demonstrated no significant 
difference between the two interventions (MD = 0.26, 95% CI, −1.7 
to 2.2) (see Figure 4).
Comparison of SSRI Versus All No SSRI 
Interventions, Including Placebo
Contrary to the comparison above, another suggestion was 
made to make a comparison in a similar fashion but including

placebo as an “intervention” (see later in the discussions). 
Data  from  SSRI  vs. Placebo comparison were added to the 
previous generic inverse variance analysis. The SSRI + CBT vs. 
Placebo arm of POTS study was not included in the analysis, as 
having a large effect size (SMD = −1.4, 95% CI: −2.0, −0.8) would 
clearly deviate the results. The pooled analysis demonstrated a 
mean difference of −2.3, 95% CI, −3.6 to −1.1, which was of small 
size, albeit significant (see Figure 5).
Comparison of Different SSRIs
None of the identified studies utilized head-to-head design to 
directly compare outcomes of different SSRI treatments. Data 
of end-treatment CY-BOCS scores from all available studies 
reporting a treatment arm of SSRI monotherapy were compared 
using generic inverse variance and random analysis model (see 
Figure 6). Four studies were using sertraline (4, 18, 27, 32), 
four studies using fluoxetine (25, 28–30), two studies using 
fluvoxamine (26, 33), one study using paroxetine (31), and one 
study using citalopram (28). The standard deviations or errors 
were reported in all articles except in Alaghband et al., for 
which the reported p values (<0.001 for both arms) were used to 
ascertain the possible t values from the t tables and to calculate 
the standard errors with Rev Man calculator (28). The estimated 
t and p values for fluoxetine and citalopram were t = 4.54, p = 
0.0005 and t = 4.57, p = 0.0005, respectively. These converted to 
standard errors of SE = 3.3 and SE = 3.7, respectively.
The pooled results of studies that used the same SSRI were 
compared visually, and any gross differences (exceeding 2 
points on CY-BOCS) were evaluated via the I2 statistic (which 
is incorporated in Rev Man). This was facilitated by unchecking 
all the other subgroups not to be compared. The two largest 
subgroups, namely, the sertraline and fluoxetine, encompassing 
four studies each, appeared to achieve similar results (endtreatment mean CY-BOCS = 14.8 (95% CI, 12.5–17.1; and 14.7, 
95% CI: 13.0, 16.4; respectively). The largest grossly visualized 
difference was detected between subgroups of fluoxetine and 
fluvoxamine (14.7, 95% CI: 13.0, 16.4; 18.5; 95% CI, 16.6 to 
20.4; respectively), mandating an evaluation of heterogeneity 
between them. Once the other subgroups were unchecked 
from Rev Man, the test for subgroup differences displayed as:

notifies of considerable heterogeneity, suggesting a possibility 
of fluoxetine’s superiority. Similar findings were noted when

DISCUSSIONS
Summary of Main Results SSRI Versus 
Placebo
SSRIs are clearly effective compared to placebo for treating OCD 
in adolescents and children, but the effect size is small (SMD = 
−0.43), which converts to 3.5-point reduction in the CY-BOCS 
score. The clinical implication of this finding is hard to evaluate, 
as even though the change is statistically significant, some 3.5 
points reduced from the initial CY-BOCS of 25 is merely little 
symptom reduction to a score of 21.5, which by no means can 
be designated as response (in this scenario such reduction 
constitutes 14% and grossly differs from those defined in the 
literature, e.g. 25%, 30%, 40% reduction or CY-BOCS ≤16). Since 
the RCTs were conducted in a mean time period of 8 weeks, the 
observed effect represents only the short-term finding. Further 
studies with longer trial durations are required to assess the longterm effects and benefits of SSRI monotherapy.
Using the method put forward by Chinn (37), the pooled 
response rate transforms to SMD of 0.5, which in contrary to that 
seen in continuous outcomes, is already of moderate effect size. 
Summarizing the findings of dichotomous outcome comparison, 
it suffices to note, that the implicated definitions of 25%, 30%, 
or 40% reductions do not necessarily mean clinically significant 
symptom reduction but represent more conservative cutoffs to 
define minimal observable change (37). By far, the achieved 20% 
absolute risk reduction (RD) converts to a number needed to treat 
(NOT) of five patients, which could be interpreted as follows: one 
would need to treat five patients to achieve minimal clinically 
noticeable change in a single patient. Similar to response rates are 
those regarding remission, as defined CY-BOCS ≤11. Although 
reported in only one study, the absolute risk difference of

remission was 18%, which converts to NNT = 6 patients, which 
is somewhat consistent with that of response, adding a valuable 
notice, which for each six treated patients, one will respond 
and another one will probably experience remission. The lack 
of studies evaluating remission rates in SSRI vs. Placebo design 
limits the value of the later statement. The observed effect size for 
children and adolescents is somewhat similar to those reported 
in treatment trials of adults with OCD (38).
The reported findings across studies are overall reliable, as 
judged from risk of bias, albeit heterogeneous. The interpretations 
regarding the effectiveness of SSRI versus Placebo presented above 
are mainly consistent with those previously stated (21, 22, 39).
Future studies with the mentioned design are less probable, the 
reason being twofold. First, being superior over placebo does not 
yet advocate for the intervention’s clinical implications, especially 
when an even more effective treatment option clearly exists. Such 
an option, exemplified herein by CBT, has been fairly validated, 
and its efficacy in children and adolescents has been confirmed 
multiple times by various studies (11, 20, 21, 40–42). Second, 
leaving the “placebo” arms of children untreated for the study 
duration would be somewhat unethical. It is generally considered, 
that a comparison of this or that intervention with the current 
“gold standard” treatment would be far more appropriate in such 
settings. This has been clearly stated in the clinical epidemiology 
textbook by Haynes (43). It is expected that further research 
examining the efficacy of SSRIs in OCD treatment would more 
commonly use SSRI vs. CBT design, or evaluate the added benefit 
of SSRIs (e.g., SSRI + CBT vs. CBT), as discussed below.
The Effectiveness of SSRI in Other 
Comparisons
The only study comparing the combination of SSRI and CBT 
with placebo (4) found the former to be highly effective, with 
a mean CY-BOCS reduction of 10, which in clinical practice 
obviously would make a difference: bringing the CY-BOCS of 
a patient from 25 to 15 would denote both clinically important 
symptom reduction and match the definition of “response,” 
albeit not that of “remission” (4). Also, a 50% risk reduction 
was observed for remission, which transforms into NNT =  2. 
Despite  these  findings, only the end-treatment scores were 
compared instead of change scores. Thus, the validity of the finding 
FIGURE 6 | Comparison of SSRI end-treatment CY-BOCS scores. A generic inverse variance analysis.

cannot be ascertained. Besides, clinicians do not usually prescribe 
placebos to proudly state that the combination is superior to it, 
neither is the comparison of any value, as both CBT and SSRI are 
interventions and both could have contributed to the change, and 
the study cannot distinguish the input effect of each. As stated 
above, few studies of such designs are expected in the future.
There were two studies comparing the combination to SSRI 
monotherapy (4, 26) and two studies comparing it to CBT 
monotherapy (4, 24). A significant benefit was observed when 
adding CBT to SSRI treatment (with a mean five-point difference 
in CY-BOCS), but no significant difference after adding SSRI to 
CBT treatment. Both findings point to the superiority of CBT 
monotherapy and question the value of adding SSRI to the 
already effective treatment regimen with no additional benefit. In 
contrast to these findings, the pooled analysis of the three trials 
with a head-to-head comparison of SSRI and CBT (4, 18, 27) did 
not find any significant difference between the treatment options, 
albeit two studies weakly favored CBT, and one weakly favored 
SSRI. All three demonstrated small effect sizes. These findings 
raise the possibility that SSRI and CBT could be equally effective 
options, to begin with, but if the initial treatment is chosen to 
be CBT, adding an SSRI regimen would not have additive effect, 
although if the SSRI was the option to begin with, adding CBT 
sessions would be beneficial to the already “responsive” patient.
The limitation regarding trial duration is as well relevant here, 
and the question “which treatment option would hold the benefit 
for the longest period” is of important clinical implication.
The findings summarized above are mainly consistent with 
observations from adult studies (23). We conclude that SSRI 
and CBT could be equal options regarding initial effectiveness, 
which somewhat differs from the previous meta-analysis (39), 
although we appreciate the large effect sizes that CBT contributes 
to outcomes in various study designs.
Overall Effectiveness of SSRIs
To evaluate the overall effect of SSRIs across various treatment 
regimens, the effect sizes of all comparisons made between arms 
that involved an SSRI and those without an SSRI were entered 
into a generic inverse variance analysis. At first, placebos were not 
considered, and the overall benefit of SSRIs across four studies [6 
comparisons, 2 intervention arms in each of Storch et al. (24); and 
POTS (4)] did not reach significance, but after adding the studies 
comparing SSRI to placebo, a small, albeit significant difference 
was noted (4, 24). The interpretation of such findings is difficult. 
The authors concluded that the overall effectiveness is small and 
is mostly seen in studies comparing to placebo. The findings are 
consistent with the common clinical scenario, where prescribing 
an SSRI to a child with OCD, who is already receiving CBT, does 
not improve symptoms significantly over the course of 8 weeks 
and continued CBT.
Differences in SSRI Effectiveness
It suffices to say that the method implemented here was bizarre 
and nowhere near a head-to-head comparison or a network metaanalysis, but it was worth entertaining the idea that one SSRI 
could be superior over another (e.g., fluoxetine vs. fluvoxamine), 
thus setting soil for future investigations and direct comparisons. 
Overall the findings suggested the similar efficacy of fluoxetine 
and sertraline and favored these two over fluvoxamine, based on 
considerable effect size heterogeneity. As already mentioned, this 
does not replace direct comparisons, which are expected to take 
place in the future in part by RCTs probably receiving funding by 
pharmaceutical companies.
LIMITATIONS
The most important limitation is the paucity of studies 
incorporated into meta-analyses, which clearly prevents the 
use of more sophisticated research tools and publication bias 
reporting with funnel plots and trims and fill technique. The 
limitation of excluding non-English studies is also recognized.
CONCLUSIONS
The authors conclude that the results of current systematic 
review and meta-analysis support the existing NICE guidelines 
for choosing CBT as the first line of treatment or substituting 
it with an SSRI for patient preference matters, as both options 
seem to be equally effective and the choice rather depends on 
patient compliance with either option. Adding CBT to current 
SSRI treatment is an effective option for non-responders and 
partial responders but adding SSRI to ongoing CBT does not 
hold a significant benefit. The SSRIs have different effectiveness, 
and their relative efficacy remains to be investigated.
FUTURE RESEARCH
Head-to-head studies are required to evaluate the relative efficacy 
of different SSRIs, and a number of new direct studies are needed 
to compare SSRIs and CBT. Considering the interesting outcomes 
of group CBT, further studies should evaluate this intervention. 
The reported outcomes are expected to include pre- and posttreatment CY-BOCS scores, change from baseline and respective 
standard deviations, response and remission rates, with more 
homogenous definitions. A research guide from authorities for 
investigating treatment in children and adolescents with OCD 
would be appropriate and of great help to settle such reporting 
discrepancies. Regulations regarding study duration would also 
contribute to the future research to evaluate the long-term effects 
of different treatment regimens, which by all means remains 
uninvestigated in children and adolescents with OCD.

Background: Specialized inpatient or residential treatment might be an alternative
treatment approach for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that do not
respond satisfactorily to the standard outpatient treatment formats.
Method: The aim of this open trial was to investigate the 6-month effectiveness of a 3week inpatient treatment of OCD, where exposure with response prevention (ERP) was
the main treatment intervention. The sample consisted of 187 adult patients with OCD,
all with previous treatment attempts for OCD.
Results: The sample showed signiﬁcant reductions in symptoms of OCD and
depression. The effect sizes were large for obsessive-compulsive symptoms and
moderate to large for depressive symptoms. At discharge, 79.7% of the intent-totreat (ITT) group were classiﬁed as treatment responders (≥35% reduction in Y-BOCS
scores). However, some participants experienced relapse, as 61.5% of the ITT group
were classiﬁed as treatment responders at 6-month follow-up. Antidepressant use
appeared not to inﬂuence the outcome. Only pre-treatment levels of obsessivecompulsive symptoms emerged as a signiﬁcant predictor of relapse.
Conclusion: The 3-week inpatient programme produced similar treatment effects as
previous inpatient and residential studies of longer duration (2 – 3 months). The results
suggest that patients with severe OCD can be treated efﬁciently using this brief inpatient
format. However, better relapse prevention interventions are needed.

INTRODUCTION
The eﬃcacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) has been conﬁrmed in numerous studies and meta-analyses (e.g., Eddy et al., 2004; Öst et al.,
2015; Skapinakis et al., 2016). According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
guidelines’ (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2005), outpatient CBT
including exposure and response prevention (ERP) should be oﬀered to all OCD patients. Among

treatment completers, signiﬁcant improvement in obsessivecompulsive symptoms is achieved by two-thirds of the patients,
which corresponds to uncontrolled eﬀect sizes around 1.5
at post-treatment (Eddy et al., 2004). In intention-to-treat
samples including treatment dropouts, about half of the patients
experience 25–50% reduction in their obsessive-compulsive
symptoms (Eddy et al., 2004). This leaves a subset of OCD
patients failing to achieve satisfactory response to CBT, and
many experience residual symptoms or relapse during follow-up
(Simpson et al., 2005; Abramowitz, 2006).
In cases where OCD patients have not responded satisfactorily
to ﬁrst-line standard outpatient treatments such as CBT,
specialized inpatient or residential treatment might be an
alternative treatment approach (National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2005). A review of inpatient and
residential treatment programs using CBT for OCD (Veale et al.,
2016b) showed that patients with severe or treatment refractory
OCD can make signiﬁcant improvements with this treatment
format. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding its longterm beneﬁts, especially regarding treatments of shorter duration.
Consequently, the primary aim of the current study was to
explore the 6-month eﬀectiveness of a brief (3 weeks) inpatient
treatment format.
An inpatient setting has therapy and support staﬀavailable
both day and night, whereas a residential setting has nursing
staﬀduring the day only. According to the National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] (2005) guidelines’,
inpatient or residential treatment may be beneﬁcial when there
is extreme distress or functional impairment, risk to life, severe
self-neglect, or where a patient has comorbid disorders that
make outpatient treatment more complex. Inpatient services may
also be required when the response to previous OCD treatment
was poor and the patient needs more intensive CBT or more
assisted exposure than what is possible to deliver in an outpatient
setting. However, a major drawback is the cost of treatment, as
well as the diﬀerent context in which the obsessive-compulsive
symptoms naturally occur. Compared to an outpatient setting, an
inpatient or residential treatment may give fewer opportunities
to consolidate and generalize the learning to the patients’ home
environment (Craske et al., 2008).
Several naturalistic studies have investigated the eﬀectiveness
of specialized inpatient or residential treatment for OCD, and the
results are promising (e.g., Stewart et al., 2005; Boschen et al.,
2008; Langner et al., 2009; Adams et al., 2012; Björgvinsson et al.,
2013; Dowling et al., 2016; Veale et al., 2016a). Two of the largest
studies of inpatient and residential OCD treatment to date are
conducted by Stewart et al. (2005) and Veale et al. (2016a).
Stewart et al. (2005) investigated the eﬀectiveness of an
American intensive residential treatment unit with a mean
treatment duration of 66 days (N = 403). Results indicated a
mean improvement in OCD symptoms of 30%, as Yale-Brown
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores decreased from
pre-treatment (M = 26.6, SD = 18.6) to post-treatment (M = 18.6,
SD = 7.2). Depressive symptoms also improved signiﬁcantly.
Follow-up scores were not reported, but in a second study using
a diﬀerent OCD sample from the same residential treatment unit,
Stewart et al. (2009) found treatment gains to be stable 6 months
after discharge. However, one limitation of the follow-up study
was low sample size (N = 36 at 6 months).
Veale et al. (2016a) described treatment outcomes from a
British residential unit, where one of the aims was to compare an
intensive treatment program of 2 weeks (N = 54) to a “standard”
treatment program of 12 weeks (N = 418). Results indicated
signiﬁcant decreases from pre- to post-treatment in both groups.
In the standard treatment program, Y-BOCS scores decreased
from a mean of 30.8 (SD = 6.0) to an average discharge score
of 18.6 (SD = 7.8). In the intensive treatment program, Y-BOCS
scores decreased from 30.1 (SD = 5.5) to 20.8 (SD = 7.5). There
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in treatment outcome between the
two programs. However, Y-BOCS follow-up scores were only
reported on the 12-week program, with 6 – 12 month followup scores showing a slight deterioration in outcome compared
to discharge (M = 22.6, SD = 7.9).
As previously mentioned, Veale et al. (2016b) conducted
a systematic review of inpatient and residential treatment
programs using CBT for OCD. The analysis included 19
studies with a total of 2306 participants at admission and
2202 participants at discharge. The average length of stay was
10.4 weeks (range: 5.0 – 19.3 weeks), whereas the average mean
Y-BOCS at pre-treatment was 27.61 (range: 24.1 – 34.7). The
meta-analysis showed a substantial amount of heterogeneity in
the estimate of treatment eﬀect size, which Veale et al. (2016b)
partly explained by the wide nature of the treatment programs
oﬀered, as well as variations in admission criteria. Nonetheless,
a large treatment eﬀect with Hedges g of 1.87 and a mean
improvement of 10.7 (95% CI: 9.8 – 11.5) points from admission
to discharge on the Y-BOCS were found. Accordingly, Veale et al.
(2016b) concluded that inpatient and residential treatment is an
encouraging option for those with severe or treatment refractory
OCD. As few studies have evaluated the long-term eﬀectiveness
of their inpatient or residential treatment, Veale et al. (2016b)
did not calculate mean change in Y-BOCS scores from admission
to follow-up. However, the results of the few studies that have
reported long-term outcomes are inconsistent, with some studies
reporting the gains to be stable (e.g., Kordon et al., 2005; Rufer
et al., 2005; Stewart et al., 2009), whereas some found a slight
deterioration (McKenzie and Marks, 2003; Veale et al., 2016a).
Research on predictors of long-term outcome is also scarce.
However, Stewart et al. (2009) found that patients who relapsed
at 6-month follow-up were signiﬁcantly more likely to be living
alone and less likely to have comorbid illnesses.
In general, the main ﬁnding of previous naturalistic research
on the eﬀectiveness of inpatient and residential treatment
for OCD indicates that inpatient services may be a viable
treatment option for patients who do not respond satisfactorily
to outpatient treatment. However, there is a lack of studies
with follow-up data, and the studies that do report follow-up
are often limited by low sample size. Furthermore, most of the
previous studies (84.2% of the studies included in the metaanalysis by Veale et al., 2016b) report inpatient or residential

Brief Inpatient Treatment of OCD
treatments with duration of 2–3 months, and there are only
a few studies (e.g., Veale et al., 2016a) that have investigated
the eﬀectiveness of a brief inpatient or residential format.
From both cost-eﬀectiveness and a clinical perspective, it is
important to explore whether a briefer inpatient or residential
treatment format could produce similar results as treatment
formats of longer duration, both at discharge and at a longer
term.
Consequently, the primary aim of this study was to explore
the 6-month eﬀectiveness of a brief psychological (no changes
in medication) inpatient treatment format with duration of
3 weeks. In light of recent research on intensive treatment formats
(e.g., Jónsson et al., 2015), it was hypothesized that obsessivecompulsive symptoms would show a signiﬁcant reduction
from admission to discharge, with some deterioration between
discharge and 6-month follow-up. As a secondary outcome
measure, the outcome pattern of depressive symptoms was
examined; the hypothesis being that depressive symptoms would
show a similar pattern as obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
Third, since the majority of previous studies of inpatient
and residential treatment of OCD see pharmacotherapy as an
integral component of their treatment (e.g., Rufer et al., 2005;
Stewart et al., 2005; Adams et al., 2012), our last aim was to
explore the inﬂuence of antidepressant medication on treatment
outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedure
The sample consisted of 187 consecutively admitted patients
with OCD who were ﬁrst-time admissions to a 3-week inpatient
treatment in a specialized anxiety unit in Norway. Out of these,
166 were treatment completers and 21 (11.2%) were dropouts.
Patients were included in this study if they met DSM-IV criteria
for OCD according to the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule
(ADIS-IV, Brown et al., 1994), and if OCD was considered the
principal diagnosis. The primary reasons for admission to the
specialized inpatient treatment were inadequate response to prior
outpatient treatment and/or presence of severe OCD.
As shown in the participant ﬂow diagram (Figure 1), 427
patients were originally assessed for inclusion in this study.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: no diagnosis of OCD/OCD
not primary diagnosis (n = 118); psychosis (n = 19); patients
assessed as eligible for outpatient treatment rather than inpatient
treatment (n = 23). Forty-ﬁve (19.4%) patients were oﬀered
inpatient treatment, but refused. Furthermore, 35 OCD patients
treated at the clinic were not included in the analysis due
to missing both pre- and post-treatment data. The data was
collected through paper and pencil and internet administration.
All outcome measures were part of the standard quality control
instruments of the health services oﬀered at the inpatient unit.
The medical quality registry was approved by the local Data
Protection Oﬃcial for Research (Reference Number: 12/5755)
and the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research
Ethics (Reference Number: 2010/2883). All subjects gave written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment
The inpatient treatment program for OCD was organized into
separate phases for assessment and treatment. At their ﬁrst
arrival at the unit, the OCD patients went through a thorough
diagnostic evaluation and assessment of suitability for treatment.
This assessment had a duration of 3 to 5 days and was performed
by the therapists at the inpatient unit. In addition to the
diﬀerential diagnostic evaluation where ADIS-IV (Brown et al.,
1994) and several self-report questionnaires (e.g., The ObsessiveCompulsive Inventory-Revised; Foa et al., 2002) were used, a
detailed summary of the patients’ obsessions and compulsions
was made. This was later used as a basis for formulation of the
anxiety hierarchy and designation of exposure exercises.
Another important ingredient in the assessment phase was
psychoeducation concerning anxiety and OCD, as well as
providing a rationale for ERP. The rationale given was not
based on habituation or disconﬁrmation of cognitive beliefs,
but with a main focus on how the exposure exercises should
be conducted. The patients were informed that obsessional
thoughts were normal and without risk, and that OCD
was developed and maintained by strategies with an aim
of controlling obsessional thoughts. An important aim of
treatment was therefore to teach the patients to confront their
obsessional thoughts and feelings in the opposite way, i.e.,
seek out anxiety and discomfort rather than trying to reduce
and/or control it. For learning and motivational purposes,
the patients also tried out a couple of exposure exercises.
In the end of the assessment stay, a 30-min motivational
interview regarding the patients’ treatment motivation was
conducted.
Due to waiting lists, the average time between assessment and
treatment start was 3 months. The treatment phase had 3 weeks
duration with behavioral elements (ERP) as the main ingredient.
Pharmacotherapy in the form of antidepressant medication was
allowed if the dose was maintained unchanged during the 3week treatment phase, whereas use of benzodiazepines was
not permitted. A minority of patients received cognitive (e.g.,
targeting dysfunctional beliefs like perfectionism and intolerance
of uncertainty) or metacognitive (e.g., challenging thoughtfusion beliefs and beliefs about rituals; Wells, 2009) interventions
in addition to ERP. However, as the inpatient treatment program
was not strictly manualized, there is no consistent information
about the relative contribution of cognitive and metacognitive
elements added to ERP.
As previously mentioned, the main treatment intervention
was ERP. Patients performed a minimum of three exposure
exercises per day; one accompanied by personnel, one partially
assisted, and one without assistance. However, most patients
conducted several exposure exercises daily, as full response
prevention was an important aim from day one. An exposure
exercise could last anywhere from 5 min to 1 h, depending on
the issues and needs of the patient. To ensure that the exposure
exercises were carried out in the right way (i.e., chasing anxiety
and discomfort rather than trying to reduce and/or control it), the
patients ﬁlled out behavioral experiment worksheets three times
daily. Prior to exposure training, the patients were to describe
the exposure exercise, what they feared would happen, as well as

which rituals they normally would have used to reduce anxiety.
Subsequent to exposure training, they evaluated the exercise by
answering questions regarding anxiety level (0–100), degree of
belief that anxiety symptoms were dangerous (0–100), degree
of attempts to reduce/control anxiety and discomfort (0–100),
as well as encouraging the patient to think of improvements
(e.g., “What could be done to make the exposure exercise
better?”). If the patients ritualized during an exposure session,
they had to re-expose themselves to the trigger, as well as ﬁlling
out a worksheet to evaluate what went wrong, what could be done
to avoid ritualization in the future etc.
The patients were to reach the top of their exposure hierarchy
within the ﬁrst 1.5 weeks. Thereafter, during the second weekend
in the treatment phase, the patients went home on leave to
practice ERP, with an aim of generalizing and implementing
learning. The exposure tasks that had been experienced as the
most diﬃcult during their leave home became the main focus
of ERP the third and last week of treatment. The patients’
therapy progress was closely monitored by the staﬀ, with
multidisciplinary team meetings 3 days a week. The behavioral
experiment worksheets, registration of deviations from response
prevention, as well as check lists for the staﬀ’s tasks during all

phases of treatment, were also elements that were meant to ensure
treatment structure and adherence to treatment.
Relapse prevention interventions, such as the formulation of
an “old and new plan,” were also an important ingredient in the
third week of treatment. The “old and new plan” is an overview of
how the patients handled their obsessive-compulsive symptoms
previously (e.g., regarding thinking style, behavior, and focus of
attention), as well as what they had learnt regarding overcoming
obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment. Also, relevant
exposure exercises in their home environment were planned. The
patients were oﬀered short phone calls with therapists or milieu
personnel up to 3 weeks after discharge, where they could repeat
treatment rationale and evaluate exposure plans. The frequency
of these phone calls varied depending on the patients’ needs.
Treatment completers were oﬀered an additional 3-day stay at
the inpatient clinic both at 3 and 6 months after discharge, with an
aim of relapse prevention. In this period, interventions from the
treatment phase were repeated. Among treatment completers, the
rates of attendance to the follow-up stays were as follows: 77.2%
at 3-month follow-up and 63.1% at 6-month follow-up. Patients
who did not attend the 3-day follow-up stays were attempted
to be reached by telephone. Therefore, 30 (10.4%) of Y-BOCS’
follow-up interviews were done by telephone.
Therapists
The treatment was provided by a multidisciplinary team
consisting of therapists and various personnel, including nurses,
psychiatric nurses, social workers, and students. One therapist
was assigned as a case supervisor and conducted regular
individual therapy sessions, but the entire staﬀwas involved in
activities in the milieu, such as giving emotional and motivational
support, as well as conducting exposure exercises. A total of
18 therapists were involved during this study’s recruitment
period, and all were trained in diagnosis and treatment of OCD
(i.e., ERP). Thirteen therapists had completed a 2-year course
in cognitive behavioral therapy and/or metacognitive therapy.
There was ongoing supervision by experienced ERP-therapists.
Measures
The inventories were answered before assessment, before
treatment start, at post-treatment, before 3-month follow-up, and
before 6-month follow-up. To examine changes in symptoms of
OCD and depression, the following measures were used:
The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale
The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Goodman et al.,
1989) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale SelfReport (Y-BOCS-SR, Baer et al., 1993) were the primary outcome
measures of this study, as they measure the severity of obsessivecompulsive symptoms. The respondents rated ﬁve aspects of both
obsessions and compulsions: frequency, interference, distress,
resistance, and control. A 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0
(none) to 4 (extreme) was used to rate the responses, where the
range of severity was characterized as follows: 8 – 15 is considered
as mild severity, 16 – 23 as moderate, 24 – 31 as severe, and
32 – 40 as extreme. The psychometrics of the Y-BOCS is well
established (e.g., Steketee et al., 1996; Grabill et al., 2008). In our
study, the interview version was used with the ﬁrst 122 (65.2%)
recruited participants. The self-report Y-BOCS was used with
the last 65 (34.8%) participants when the inpatient unit switched
to electronic assessments. However, there is a strong correlation
between the two versions of Y-BOCS (Steketee et al., 1996). In this
study, the Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcient measured at baseline was
0.80.
The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R, Foa et al.,
2002) is a self-report form that measures severity of obsessivecompulsive symptoms. The OCI-R consists of 18 items reﬂecting
six subscales known as washing, checking, ordering, obsessions,
hoarding, and mental neutralization. A 5-point Likert scale from
0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) was used to rate the responses,
where higher scores indicate more severe obsessive-compulsive
symptoms (Foa et al., 2002). The OCI-R has demonstrated
good reliability, and good convergent and discriminant validity
(e.g., Foa et al., 2002; Abramowitz and Deacon, 2006). The
psychometric properties are also validated in a Norwegian sample
(Solem et al., 2010). In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcient
for the total scale at baseline was 0.83.
The Beck Depression Inventory
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et al., 1961) is a widely
used measure of severity of depressive symptoms. It is a selfreport form with 21 items, where each symptom is rated on
a 4-point Likert scale. The range of severity is characterized
as follows: 10 – 14 is considered as mild severity, 15 – 24
as moderate, 25 – 63 as severe. The BDI is shown to be a
highly reliable and valid measure of depression severity. In Beck
et al. (1988) review of its psychometric properties, the internal
consistency was 0.87, and test–retest reliability was greater than
0.60. Due to a switch into electronic assessment, the ﬁrst 122
patients enrolled in our study answered the BDI, whereas the last
65 respondents answered the newer version, BDI-II (Beck et al.,
1996). However, previous research has found the BDI and BDIII to be strongly correlated (Dozois et al., 1998). The Cronbach’s
alpha value was 0.89 at baseline.
Data Analyses
First, possible diﬀerences in Y-BOCS, OCI-R, and BDI scores due
to diﬀerences in administration mode (paper and pencil versus
internet administration) and variability in the measures used
(Y-BOCS versus Y-BOCS-SR, BDI versus BDI-II) were explored
through independent t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Due to
three comparisons, the critical alpha level was set at 0.02.
Second, to explore whether the inpatient group actually
was diﬀerent from an outpatient group, Pearson’s chi-square
tests and independent t-tests were used to contrast the ﬁnal
sample’s baseline demographic and diagnostic information with
characteristics of the OCD clinic’s outpatient sample from the
same period of time. Furthermore, baseline demographic and
diagnostic characteristics of study dropouts versus treatment
completers were compared using the same statistics.
Not all measurements were available for every patient at
follow-up. Among treatment completers (n = 166), number of

Brief Inpatient Treatment of OCD
respondents at 3-month follow up was as follows: Y-BOCS:
n = 142; OCI-R: n = 139; BDI: n = 139. Among treatment
completers at 6-month follow-up, number of respondents was
104 for Y-BOCS, 87 for OCI-R, and 86 for BDI. A non-signiﬁcant
Little’s MCAR test revealed that the data was missing completely
at random: χ2(127) = 149.81, p = 0.082 (Little, 1988). Expectation
maximization (EM) analysis was used to estimate the means and
standard deviations for missing data at follow-up among the
treatment completers. For each of the three scales, the available
items from each wave of data were used in the calculations,
i.e., the available items from assessment, pre-treatment, posttreatment, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. For those
with premature discharges (dropouts: n = 21), the last completed
assessment was used in the analysis (via a last-observationcarried-forward-approach). Thus, an intention-to-treat (ITT)
methodology was used in this study.
Treatment outcome data were analyzed using one-way
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). No inﬂuential
outliers were found, as measured by Cook’s distance. However,
Mauchly’s test of sphericity indicated that the assumption of
sphericity had been violated in the outcome variables: Y-BOCS:
χ2(9) = 242.5, p = 0.001; OCI-R: χ2(9) = 281.7, p = 0.001;
BDI: χ2(9) = 234.4, p = 0.001. Therefore, Greenhouse–Geisser
corrected tests were reported. Eﬀect sizes were reported as
partial eta squared (η2
p), where values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14 are
considered to reﬂect small, medium, and large eﬀects, respectively
(Cohen, 1988).
As an additional measure of treatment eﬀectiveness, the
within-subject eﬀect-sizes for changes in obsessive-compulsive
and depressive symptoms were calculated with Cohens d,
correcting for related means by using the equation by Morris and
DeShon (2002). An eﬀect size of 0.20 – 0.49 is considered small,
0.50 – 0.79 as moderate, and ≥0.80 as large.
To
examine
whether
changes
in
obsessive-compulsive
symptoms were clinically meaningful, clinically signiﬁcant
change analyses were carried out on Y-BOCS and OCI-R scores
at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. The international
consensus criteria for Y-BOCS (Mataix-Cols et al., 2016) were
chosen as the primary clinically signiﬁcant change estimate,
where treatment response is operationalized as a ≥35% reduction
in Y-BOCS scores and a partial treatment response as a ≥25%
but < 35% reduction. Remission is deﬁned as having a Y-BOCS
score ≤12.
Since inconsistencies in how treatment response are deﬁned
in clinical trials have been shown to lead to diﬀerent estimates
of treatment eﬃcacy and relapse rates (Simpson et al., 2005),
Fisher and Wells’ (2005) criteria were included as an additional
clinical signiﬁcance change measure on Y-BOCS scores. Thus,
the proportion of patients who (1) recover, (2) make statistically
reliable improvement, and (3) remain unchanged were calculated.
To meet criteria of recovery, the patients needed a score of 14
points or less, as well as a reliable change index (RCI) of minimum
10 points change following treatment. To achieve “statistically
reliable improvement,” only the RCI criteria of minimum 10
points change applied. The proportion of patients that had a posttreatment and 6-month follow-up score at or below the cut-oﬀ
(≤14) was also calculated.
In the clinically signiﬁcant change analysis on OCI-R
scores, the same classiﬁcation of recovery, statistically reliable
improvement, and no change, was used. Similar criteria as used
by Solem et al. (2009) were applied, with a cut-oﬀscore of 21 and
RCI of 12.
The potential inﬂuence of antidepressant use on treatment
outcome was investigated using independent t-tests, where the
Y-BOCS post-treatment and 6-month scores of antidepressant
users versus non-users were contrasted. In addition, the
impact of antidepressant dose was explored using the World
Health Organization’s (World Health Organization Collaborating
Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology [WHO], 2015) “deﬁned
daily doses” (DDD) methodology. Each patients’ antidepressant
dose was converted into a DDD-score, where all DDD’s were
based on the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre
for Drug Statistics Methodology [WHO] (2015) guidelines. To
explore the relationship between dose and Y-BOCS treatment
outcome, correlational analyses of Y-BOCS post-treatment and
6-month scores and DDD-scores were conducted.
Lastly, a logistic regression analysis was used to explore
predictors of relapse at 6-month follow-up. Relapse was deﬁned
using Mataix-Cols et al.’s (2016) criteria; the patient initially
classiﬁed as being in remission (i.e., a Y-BOCS score of 12 or
lower), but no longer met this criteria at follow-up. The patients’
relapse status (relapse versus remained in remission) was entered
as the dependent variable, whereas gender, age, marital status
(single vs. married/cohabitant), pre-treatment Y-BOCS and BDI
scores, and attendance to the follow-up stay 3 months after
discharge were entered as predictor variables. Multicollinearity
did not appear as a problem with any of the predictor variables,
with VIF ranging from 1.03 – 1.28 and tolerance from 0.78 to
0.98. No inﬂuential observations were found (measured by Cook’s
distance, leverage, and the standardized residuals).
RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
The data was collected through both paper and pencil (n = 122
at baseline) and internet administration (n = 65 at baseline).
Independent t-tests showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the two administration modes at baseline, neither in Y-BOCS
scores, t(185) = 0.48, p = 0.634, OCI-R scores, t(185) = −0.05,
p = 0.957, nor BDI scores, t(93.5) = −1.42, p = 0.160.
Participant Characteristics
A description of the ﬁnal sample’s baseline demographic
and diagnostic information is provided in Table 1. Their
characteristics are contrasted with characteristics of the same
clinic’s outpatient OCD sample from the same time period.
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two samples were found,
indicating higher severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and
life impairment in the inpatient sample. The inpatients were
older, reported more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and
lower rates of employment/student status. Also, the inpatients
had a more extensive treatment history and used more
antidepressant medication.

As Veale et al. (2016a) pointed out, there is a wide variety
between previous inpatient and residential studies regarding
admission criteria and sample characteristics. The current sample
may be diﬀerent from some of the previous samples, as there
was no ﬁxed admission criteria regarding Y-BOCS severity,
whereas studies like Boschen et al. (2010) and Veale et al. (2016a)
had an inclusion criterion of Y-BOCS ≥30. In addition, the
current inpatient service had no criteria regarding the number
of previously failed treatments, even though most of the patients
had previous treatment attempts for OCD (see Table 1). A third
distinction is related to economy. The stay at the inpatient unit
was ﬁnanced by the national health care system in Norway (i.e.,
not self-payed or covered by private insurance providers). Thus,
the inpatient service may have been more accessible in Norway as
compared to other countries. However, despite these diﬀerences,
the mean pre-treatment Y-BOCS from the 19 studies described
in Veale et al. (2016b) is similar to scores in the current study
(see Figure 2). The studies with the lowest (Kuelz et al., 2006)
and highest (Boschen et al., 2010) mean pre-treatment Y-BOCS
in Veale et al. (2016b) are also displayed.
Comparison of Treatment Completers
and Dropouts
As shown in Table 2, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was identiﬁed
between completers (n = 166) and dropouts (n = 21) with respect
to Y-BOCS, OCI-R, and BDI severity measured at baseline.
However, signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found regarding gender,
χ2(1,N = 187) = 12.57, p = 0.001, and prior inpatient treatment,
χ2(1,N = 187) = 6.45, p = 0.011. Among dropouts, there was a
higher proportion of males and higher percentage participants
with previous inpatient treatment.
Treatment Effectiveness
Assessment, admission, discharge, and follow-up scores for the
Y-BOCS, the OCI-R, and the BDI are presented in Table 3.
Means and standard deviations are reported for each measure for
treatment completers and the ITT sample.
The results of the repeated measures ANOVA showed
a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of time on Y-BOCS outcome,
F(2.6,476.2) = 306.0, p = 0.001, η2
p = 0.62. Post hoc tests with
Bonferroni correction showed a small, but signiﬁcant decrease
in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from assessment phase to
treatment start (p = 0.014), as well as a signiﬁcant decrease
from treatment start to discharge (p = 0.001). The data further
indicated an increase in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from
discharge to 3-months follow-up (p = 0.001), followed by
stability in symptom severity between 3-month and 6-month
follow-up (p = 0.989). On average, this represented a 52%
decrease in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from assessment
to discharge, and a 36% decrease from assessment to 6-month
follow-up.
The analysis was repeated with OCI-R as measure of
obsessive-compulsive symptoms. With the exception of a nonsigniﬁcant decrease between assessment phase and treatment
start (p = 0.061), the same pattern in symptom changes emerged.
Overall, there was a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of time on
obsessive-compulsive symptoms, F(2.2,403.6) = 240.4, p = 0.001,
η2
p = 0.68. Post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction showed
a signiﬁcant decrease in symptoms between assessment and
discharge (p = 0.001), a signiﬁcant increase in symptoms between
discharge and 3-month follow-up, (p = 0.001), followed by
stability in symptom level between 3- and 6-month followup (p = 0.999). This represented, on average, a decrease of
56% in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from assessment to
discharge, and a decrease of 42% from assessment to 6-month
follow-up.
Regarding
depressive
symptoms,
the
outcome
pattern
was similar to obsessive-compulsive symptoms. There was a
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of time on depressive symptoms,
as measured with the BDI, F(2.5,465.1) = 112.4, p = 0.001,
η2
p = 0.55. Post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction showed a
non-signiﬁcant decrease in symptoms between assessment phase
and treatment start (p = 0.170) and a signiﬁcant decrease in
symptoms between assessment phase and discharge (p = 0.001).
Furthermore, there was a signiﬁcant increase in symptoms
between discharge and 3-month follow-up (p = 0.001), followed
by stability in symptom level between 3- and 6-month follow-up
(p = 0.999). On average, this represented a 53% decrease in
depressive symptoms from assessment to discharge, and a 35%
decrease from assessment to 6-month follow-up.
The within-subject eﬀect-sizes for changes in obsessivecompulsive and depressive symptoms are presented in Table 3.
The eﬀect sizes from assessment phase to discharge, as well
as assessment phase to follow-up, were large for obsessivecompulsive symptoms and moderate to large for depressive
symptoms. See Figure 3 for a comparison of eﬀect size estimates
from the current study and the meta-analysis of 19 inpatient and
residential treatment programs using CBT for OCD (Veale et al.,
2016b). The comparison showed that the ITT group’s eﬀect size

from assessment phase to discharge was similar to the eﬀect size

had a higher eﬀect size estimate.

Following Mataix-Cols et al.’s (2016) criteria, the Y-BOCS
results for the ITT group at post-treatment were as follows:

79.7% were classiﬁed as treatment responders, 5.3% as partial
responders, 57.8% met criteria for remission, whereas 15% had
no change in symptoms. At 6-month follow-up, 61.5% were
classiﬁed as treatment responders and 8.0% as partial responders.
A proportion of 34.2% met criteria for remission, whereas 30.5%
had no change in symptoms.
Variability in how treatment response was deﬁned did lead
to diﬀerent estimates of treatment eﬃcacy and relapse rates.
Following Fisher and Wells’ (2005) clinically signiﬁcant change
criteria for Y-BOCS scores, 71.1% of treatment completers
and 63.1% of the ITT group were classiﬁed as recovered
at post-treatment. Similar results were found for OCI-R
scores; 65.6% of treatment completers and 58.2% of the
ITT sample met criteria for recovery at discharge. At 6month follow-up, 35.3 – 40.1% of the ITT sample were
classiﬁed as recovered, whereas an additional proportion
of 10.7 – 12.8% were classiﬁed as signiﬁcantly improved,
as measured by OCI-R and Y-BOCS. See Table 4 for a
summary of the results from the clinically signiﬁcant change
analyses.
Inﬂuence of Antidepressant Use
At baseline, 54% of the sample reported use of antidepressant
medication (mainly SSRI’s). The most frequently used were
Cipralex (n = 29) and Zoloft (n = 21), followed by Anafranil,
Seroxat, and Fluoxetin (each with n = 7). Regarding dose, 60%
were higher than the drug’s DDD, 35% were at the level of
the recommended DDD, whereas 5% were below the DDD.
A proportion of 76% held dose levels unchanged during the whole
treatment phase. Before treatment start, 4% reduced the dose and
9% stopped using anti-depressants. Between post-treatment and
6 months follow-up, 1% reduced the dose and 11% stopped using
antidepressants.

Predictors of Relapse
A logistic regression analysis was used to explore predictors of
relapse at 6-month follow-up. Patients who relapsed following
discharge comprised 28.9% of the sample (n = 54). Pre-treatment
levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Y-BOCS) emerged as
the only signiﬁcant predictor of relapse, B = 0.17, SE = 0.06,
p = 0.003. Each unit increase in Y-BOCS severity at pre-treatment
was associated with an increase in the odds of relapse by a
factor of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.06 – 1.33). Neither gender (B = 0.44,
SE = 0.46, p = 0.347), age (B = −0.02, SE = 0.02, p = 0.262),
marital status (B = 0.36, SE = 0.47, p = 0.443), pre-treatment
levels of depression (B = −0.01, SE = 0.02, p = 0.624), nor
attendance to the 3-day follow-up stay 3 months after discharge
(B = 0.31, SE = 0.52, p = 0.546) emerged as signiﬁcant predictors
of relapse.
DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst study investigating the long-term outcome
of a 3-week inpatient treatment for OCD. Consistent with
this study’s hypothesis, the results indicated that the treatment
delivered was eﬀective. At discharge, 79.7% of the patients

Results are displayed in percentages. For Y-BOCS, Mataix-Cols et al.’s (2016) criteria are reported as the primary clinically signiﬁcant change estimate, whereas the
criteria recommended by Fisher and Wells (2005) are included as an additional change measure. The criteria by Fisher and Wells (2005) are listed in parentheses. For
OCI-R, similar criteria as used by Solem et al. (2009) were applied. Y-BOCS, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale; OCI-R, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised;
ITT, intent-to-treat sample.
were classiﬁed as treatment responders regarding obsessivecompulsive symptoms. The dropout rate was low (11.2%),
indicating that the treatment was considered acceptable for
most patients. There was an increase in obsessive-compulsive
symptoms from post-treatment to 3-month follow-up, followed
by stability in symptom severity between 3 and 6 months. At 6month follow-up, 61.5% of the patients showed a full treatment
response, indicating that some patients were still unchanged
or had relapsed. The outcome pattern of depressive symptoms
was similar to obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Antidepressant
use appeared not to inﬂuence the outcome. Only pre-treatment
level of obsessive-compulsive symptoms emerged as a signiﬁcant
predictor of relapse.
Compared to previous studies of inpatient and residential
treatment for OCD (e.g., Kordon et al., 2005; Stewart et al.,
2005; Veale et al., 2016a), where the majority report treatment
durations of 2–3 months, the current study displays a similar
treatment eﬀect at discharge. In the meta-analysis of residential
and inpatient OCD treatment, Veale et al. (2016b) found a mean
reduction in Y-BOCS scores from baseline to post-treatment at
10.7 points, whereas the mean reduction score in the ITT-sample
in our study was 12.5. This indicates that a brief inpatient format
can produce a similar post-treatment result as inpatient formats
of longer duration.
Despite very encouraging post-treatment results, there was
some relapse at follow-up. Overall, the current changes in
obsessive-compulsive symptoms from assessment phase to 6month follow-up showed large eﬀect sizes, but the results
indicated an increase in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from
post-treatment to 3-month follow-up, followed by stability
in symptom severity between 3-month and 6-month followup. The results of previous inpatient and residential studies
reporting long-term outcomes are inconsistent, with some
studies reporting the gains to be stable (e.g., Kordon et al., 2005;
Rufer et al., 2005; Stewart et al., 2009), whereas some found
a slight deterioration (McKenzie and Marks, 2003; Veale
et al., 2016a). One explanation for the diﬀerential results
may be methodological, as the heterogeneity in treatment and
populations among the studies who report follow-up data is
large. With the exception of Veale et al. (2016a, N = 124
at Y-BOCS at 6–12 months follow-up), most of the previous
inpatient and residential treatment studies reporting follow-up
data had small sample sizes (range of N: 16 – 44) and/or low
response rates. In comparison, a strength of our study is a
sample size of 142 at 3-month follow-up (i.e., 86% of treatment
completers) and 104 at 6-month follow-up (i.e., 63% of treatment
completers).
Furthermore, the diﬀerent symptom trends at follow-up
between studies might be explained by diﬀerences in treatment
duration. The increase in symptoms at 3-month follow-up
is in line with the meta-analytic ﬁndings of Jónsson et al.
(2015), suggesting that there could be more relapse in patients
receiving intensive treatment. Jónsson et al. (2015) compared
treatment eﬀects of intensive outpatient CBT with standard
weekly CBT. They found a signiﬁcantly larger post-treatment
eﬀect in the intensive treatment condition, but this diﬀerence
was no longer present at 3-month follow-up. According to
Jónsson et al. (2015), this was mainly due to some deterioration
among patients in the intensive CBT-formats. The higher
relapse rate in intensive treatment conditions may be due to
fewer opportunities to consolidate and generalize the learning
to the patients’ home environment. Craske et al. (2008)
recommend spacing of exposure trials, as well as a lot of
variability throughout exposure, to enhance the accessibility and
retrievability of learning. In our study, the majority of patients
were not settled near-by the inpatient unit. The leave home
(one weekend during the treatment phase) was designed to
address the issues of variability and generalizing learning, but one
weekend may have been too short to consolidate this learning
suﬃciently.

Brief Inpatient Treatment of OCD
In general, there is a need for more research to clarify
the relative long-term eﬀectiveness of intensive versus standard
treatment formats in both inpatient and outpatient treatment
settings, as well as further research into how to maintain the good
post-treatment eﬀects of the brief and intensive format. Use of
controlled trials with large samples yielding high response rates
at follow-up are recommended.
As hypothesized, depressive symptoms demonstrated a similar
outcome pattern as obsessive-compulsive symptoms. There was
a signiﬁcant decrease in symptoms between pre-treatment and
post-treatment, an increase between post-treatment and 3-month
follow-up, followed by stability in symptoms between 3-month
and 6-month follow-up. Overall, this resulted in a 35% decrease
in depressive symptoms from pre-treatment to follow-up. These
results are in line with previous studies examining depressive
symptoms during inpatient and residential treatment for OCD
(e.g., Stewart et al., 2009; Veale et al., 2016a). As Stewart et al.
(2009) also pointed out - whether the improvement in depressive
symptoms is primary or secondary to reduction in obsessivecompulsive symptoms, or whether the change occurred in
both symptom types simultaneously, is unknown. Nevertheless,
improvement from depressive symptoms is of clinical relevance,
as comorbid depression severity has been found to contribute to
poor quality of life (e.g., Masellis et al., 2003) and occupational
disability (e.g., Mancebo et al., 2008).
Approximately half of the sample used antidepressant
medication during treatment, but antidepressant use appeared
not to inﬂuence the outcome. There was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in Y-BOCS post-treatment and 6-month score
between antidepressant users and non-users. Also, there was
no relationship between dose and Y-BOCS treatment outcome.
These results are in line with previous studies examining
the inﬂuence of antidepressant medication on OCD inpatient
treatment outcome (e.g., Kordon et al., 2005; Rufer et al., 2005;
Langner et al., 2009). In a 2-year follow-up study of 74 inpatients
with OCD, Kordon et al. (2005) found CBT and combined
therapy (CBT + serotonin-reuptake inhibitors treatment) to
be equally eﬀective both at post-treatment and follow-up.
Furthermore, no diﬀerences in the obsessive-compulsive scores
were observed between those who continued antidepressant
medication and those who discontinued.
Only pre-treatment level of obsessive-compulsive symptoms
emerged as a signiﬁcant predictor of relapse. Neither gender, age,
marital status, pre-treatment levels of depression, nor attendance
to the follow-up stay 3 months after discharge emerged as
signiﬁcant predictors of relapse. The results are not in accordance
with the results of Stewart et al. (2009), where patients who
relapsed were found to be signiﬁcantly more likely to be living
alone. However, the results are in line with Knopp et al. (2013)
systematic review of predictors of response to psychological
therapies in OCD, as they found OCD symptom severity as one
of the few variables that was relatively consistently related to
outcome.
Limitations
Due to the naturalistic design of the study, there were no
independent raters of diagnostic information at baseline, and
there was no control group. The lack of control group may
give a false impression of eﬃciency. However, spontaneous
recovery from OCD is rare. In addition, as the inpatient treatment
program was not strictly manualized, there is no consistent
information about the relative contribution of cognitive and
metacognitive elements added to ERP.
Inevitably, data from large service evaluations are likely to
have missing data, which can bias the eﬀect of treatment on
response. The analysis adjusted for missing data at follow-up by
using EM and LOCF as imputation strategies and therefore has to
be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, there was variability in
the measures used, as both the self-report and interview versions
of the Y-BOCS were used. Similarly, for ratings of depressive
symptoms, the ﬁrst included patients used BDI, while the others
used BDI-II. However, the BDI and the BDI-II are strongly
correlated (Dozois et al., 1998), as are Y-BOCS and Y-BOCSSR (Steketee et al., 1996). In the current study, there were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in baseline scores between Y-BOCS and
Y-BOCS-SR or between BDI and BDI-II.
Another limitation concerns follow-up assessment. The
diagnostic status of OCD was not re-evaluated. Inclusion of
other potentially clinically important indicators of treatment
outcome such as anxiety and functional outcomes across multiple
settings (e.g., home, work, social life) would have improved
the study. Given that OCD is associated with impaired quality
of life and functioning (Asnaani et al., 2017), inclusion of an
inventory such as EuroQol (EuroQol-Group, 1990) could have
brought information regarding how changes in OCD severity
are associated with changes in functioning and quality of life.
Measurement of the use of outpatient care after discharge, as well
as an analysis of the cost-eﬀectiveness of the inpatient treatment,
would also have improved the study. Finally, what happens with
their obsessive-compulsive symptoms after 6 months remains
unknown.
CONCLUSION
The current study’s inpatient unit for OCD was established
in 2008. At the time, evidence-based treatments of OCD
(i.e., ERP and CBT) were diﬃcult to get in Norway due to
few available ERP specialists. Therefore, the 3-week inpatient
program was originally established as a practical arrangement
to handle referrals from the whole country. However, there
was an explicit wish to establish local specialized OCD-teams
that could carry through the OCD-treatment closer to people’s
homes and in a more cost-eﬀective way. This resulted in the
national implementation of OCD treatment in Norway and the
establishment of 30 specialized OCD-teams (Kvale and Hansen,
2014).
As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst study to look at the
eﬀectiveness of a brief (3 weeks) version of inpatient treatment
in such a large sample size, combined with long-term followup data with good response rates. This study replicates previous
ﬁndings concerning inpatient and residential treatment being
an eﬀective treatment format (e.g., Stewart et al., 2005, 2009;
Veale et al., 2016a) for severe OCD, and extends these results

to a brief version of inpatient treatment. However, the increase
in symptoms between post-treatment and 3-month follow-up
underlines the need for further research into predictors of relapse
in inpatient and residential treatment, as well as further research
into how to maintain the good post-treatment eﬀects of the brief
and intensive format. One possibility may be booster sessions
delivered by video chatting applications (Vogel et al., 2014).

Introduction
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric
disorder, characterized by persistent distressing obsessions and/or
compulsions that impair the quality of daily life, associated with
severe functional impairment (1–3). Previous research studies have
indicated that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are effective
treatments for OCD (4–9).
The therapeutic efﬁcacy of SSRIs could be supported by the
serotonergic hypothesis (10).
The hypothesis postulates the presence of an aberration,
presumably a diminution of function, within the serotonergic
system in OCD, or posits the implication of the serotonergic
system in some capacity in the pathogenesis of OCD (11–13).
Thus, the SSRIs could be effective in treating OCD might because
they target on the serotonin system (6, 14). However, it could also
be argued that the development of the serotonin hypothesis
stemmed from the efﬁcacy of SSRIs in treating OCD, there are
still numerous other medicines and treatments that are beneﬁcial
for OCD patients. Nonetheless, SSRIs is still one of the effective
treatment for OCD (15–17).
RTMS is a comparatively new treatment approach for OCD,
which was designed for resistent OCD, and those who cannot afford
the huge side effects of medicines (4, 18, 19). As a non-invasive
neuromodulation technique, rTMS harnesses rapidly altering
electromagnetic ﬁelds produced by a coil positioned on the scalp to
modulate cortical and subcortical function (5, 20, 21). By adjusting
stimulation parameters, rTMS can selectively diminish or enhance
cortical excitability in speciﬁc regions; frequencies equal to or below
1 Hz typically inhibit activity (referred to as low-frequency rTMS),
while frequencies at or above 5 Hz typically stimulate activity
(referred to as high-frequency rTMS) (22–24). As several studies
suggested, low-frequency rTMS administered over the (pre-)
supplementary motor area (pre-SMA/SMA) has been observed to
reinstate cortical inhibition in the motor cortex among OCD patients,
correlating with amelioration in OCD symptoms (20, 25–27).
However, it has been observed that some patients exhibit
inadequate response to these therapies. For instance, studies have
shown that SSRIs are ineffective for 40-60% of OCD patients (18,
28). Similarly, some studies did not observe adequate therapeutic
effect of rTMS on OCD (29–31), and there is insufﬁcient evaluation
of the therapeutic efﬁcacy of rTMS treatment on OCD (20, 32). In
light of this, the concept of candidate genes that may impact the
therapeutic effect of OCD treatments has been proposed (33), they
identiﬁed the LL allele of 5-HTTLPR (L/S) in the candidate gene
SLC6A4 as a potential bio-marker for OCD treatment. Since there
may be other bio-markers, attention has been directed towards
genes within the neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonin
transporter gene SLC6A4, the glutamate receptor gene GRIN2B, and
the gene related to serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and
epinephrine (COMT) which have been previously identiﬁed as
candidate genes for OCD (34–38).
As a gene that has already been identiﬁed as a potential candidate
for OCD treatment, SLC6A4 holds signiﬁcant value for further
investigation (33). The SLC6A4 gene can encode the serotonin
transporter (5-HTT) protein, which has the job to control the
release of serotonin (5-HT) from the synaptic terminals remove
that from the synaptic cleft (39–42). Due to the importance of
serotonin in impacting OCD, it is understandable that SLC6A4
might be the potential bio-marker for OCD treatment (6, 14, 43).
Except for the polymorphism of 5-HTTLPR (SLC6A4) that previous
research had already done with (33), the C alleles of rs16965628
(SLC6A4) have also been suggested to potentially lead to alterations
in the serotonergic system (44). Therefore, rs16965628 is suitable for
investigation in the present study, as it could be considered as a highly
possible candidate gene foe OCD (40).
Moreover, GRIN2B seem also deserve the investigation as a
possible candidate gene for OCD treatment, due to the previous
ﬁnding of the association between G allele and OCD (45). Previous
studies suggested that there is a signiﬁcant correlation between the
rs1019385 polymorphism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate 2B
glutamate receptor (GRIN2B) and reduced glutamatergic
concentration (Glx) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC);
Individuals with the GG genotype demonstrated reduced Glx
compared to those carrying the T allele (45, 46). As the reduced
Glx was suggested to be related with OCD (47), rs1019385
(GRIN2B) could also be a suitable gene for investigation in the
present study.
Furthermore, as another possible candidate gene, Catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT) serves as a pivotal enzyme in the
metabolic deactivation of dopamine and norepinephrine
catecholamines, facilitating the catabolism of dopamine (DA) (48, 49).
The Met (A) allele of Val158Met (G to A), commonly referred to as
RS4680 (COMT), is proposed to decrease enzyme activity, elevate
cortical dopamine signaling, and potentially play a role in OCD
development (50, 51). Hence, RS4680 (COMT) emerges as another
pertinent gene for investigation in the current study.
Given the limited amount of research investigating RS4680
(COMT), RS16965628 (SLC6A4), and RS1019385 (GRIN2B) as
candidate genes for OCD treatment and their strong correlation
with OCD, the present study aimed to investigate whether the
polymorphism of those three genes would inﬂuence the therapeutic
effect of rTMS and SSRIs in individuals with OCD. To achieve the
aim, a study with an experimental, between-subject, double-blind
design was conducted, with the recruitment of 36 untreated
outpatients diagnosed with OCD.
Methods and materials
Participants
This study employed an experimental, between-subject, doubleblind design. The participants consisted of 36 untreated outpatients
diagnosed with OCD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria (Figure 1).
The mean age of the participants was 31.61, with 17 males (47.22%)
and 19 females (52.78%). The study was granted ethical approval by
the Ethics Committee of Wuxi Mental Health Center, China (clinical
trials registry number: [ChiCTR1900023641]). Each participant has
received informed consent before participating.

Genotyping & therapy
All participants were randomly assigned to two different groups
for an 8-week therapy. However, as the drop-out rate was extremely
high after the second week, this study only analyzed the data of the
ﬁrst two weeks. Peripheral blood samples (5 mL) were collected
from each participant using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) vacuum tubes for genotyping purposes, speciﬁcally
examining the polymorphism of RS4680 (COMT), RS16965628
(SLC6A4), and RS1019385 (GRIN2B). In the active rTMS group,
participants received 1-Hz rTMS over the pre-supplementary
motor area (pre-SMA) once per day, 5 days per week, for 2
weeks. The pre-SMA was identiﬁed as being 15% of the distance
from the inion to the nasion along the anterior plane to the Cz
(vertex) on the sagittal midline. For the sham rTMS group, the
Neurosoft sham coil was positioned at the same location. Both
groups received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as
part of their drug therapy. Further details regarding the genotyping
and therapy used in this study can be found elsewhere (33).
Assessments
Clinical evaluations were conducted at baseline and 2 weeks
following the treatment timeline using three measuring tools: the
Chinese version of Yale–Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (YBOCS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), and the 17item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). The Chinese
version of Y-BOCS was found to be a dependable computerized
cognitive test, noted for its repeatability, sensitivity, and strong
validity and reliability (33). There were also previous research
afﬁrmed the validity and sensitivity of the Chinese editions of
HAMD and HAMA, underscoring their suitability for gauging
clinical severity in patients and endorsing their ongoing
utilization in research settings (52).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, employing the chisquare test, Related-Samples Friedman’s Two-Way Analysis of
Variance, and the Scheirer-Ray-Hare Test. The Chi-square test was
used to test the categories data such as gender. The Mann–Whitney
test, Related-Samples Friedman’s Two-Way Analysis, and the ScheirerRay-Hare Test were used to test non-normally distributed data.
Results
Demographic characteristics of
enrolled subjects
Table 1 presents descriptive and statistical comparisons of the
active rTMS and sham rTMS groups. At baseline, there were no
signiﬁcant differences between the active and sham groups in terms
of demographics or baseline clinical ratings (Table 1).
Assessment of Y-BOCS, HAMA, and HAMD
The result shows that both SSRIs and rTMS augmentation of
SSRIs led to signiﬁcant improvements in assessment scores. The YBOCS scores demonstrated a signiﬁcant decrease over time. The
Scheirer-Ray-Hare test analysis results (Table 2) for the two-week
Y-BOCS assessment showed that the main effect of the therapy type
was not signiﬁcant (H = 2.91, p > 0.05), while the main effect of the
therapy duration was signiﬁcant (H = 12.19, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.12).

(2) = 17.44, p < 0.01, W = 0.55) and sham rTMS group (c2 (2) =
9.58, p < 0.01, W = 0.24). Post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signedrank tests was conducted with a Bonferroni correction applied,
resulting in a signiﬁcance level set at p < 0.017. In the active rTMS
group, Y-BOCS scores signiﬁcantly decreased from baseline to week
1 (Z = -2.96, p < 0.017) and from baseline to week 2 (Z = -3.33, p <
0.017), while the decrease from week 1 to week 2 was not signiﬁcant
(Z = -1.74, p = 0.082). Similarly, in the sham rTMS group, Y-BOCS
scores signiﬁcantly decreased from baseline to week 2 (Z = -2.45,
p<0.017), while the decrease from baseline to week 1 (Z = -2.12, p =
0.034) and from week 1 to week 2 (Z = -1.55, p = 0.120) was not
signiﬁcant (Table 3). HAMA scores exhibited signiﬁcant changes
after therapy in both the active group (c2 (2) = 7.77, p < 0.05,
W = 0.24) and sham group(c2 (2) = 11.40, p < 0.01, W = 0.29)
(Table 3). Besides, in the active rTMS group, a signiﬁcant
change in assessment scores was found both from baseline to
week 1 (Z = -2.81, p < 0.017) and from baseline to week 2 (Z =
-2.88, p < 0.017). In the sham rTMS groups, a signiﬁcant change was
only found between baseline and week 2 (Z = -2.66, p < 0.017)
(Table 3). Additionally, the analysis of the two-week HAMD
assessment showed that the main effect of the therapy duration
was signiﬁcant (H = 10.50, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.10) (Table 2). Patients in
the active rTMS group demonstrated a signiﬁcantly larger reduction
rate at week 1 compared to the patients in the sham group (U =
93.50, p < 0.05, r = 0.354) (Figure 2). The HAMD scores showed a
signiﬁcant decrease over time in both the active rTMS (c2 (2) =
16.00, p < 0.05, W = 0.50) and sham rTMS groups (c2 (2) = 11.86,
p < 0.05, W = 0.30) (Table 3).
Effects of genotype on RS4680,
RS16965628 and RS1019385
The ﬁrst signiﬁcant difference was observed in the RS4680
genotype. No signiﬁcant differences were found in general
baseline characteristics between different genotypes. However,
signiﬁcant genotype-related effects on the intervention outcomes
were identiﬁed (Table 4). Patients with the GG genotype showed a
smaller improvement in Y-BOCS scores (H = 6.374, p < 0.05,

h2 = 0.19); and greater variability in Y-BOCS score was found in
Sham rTMS groups of GG genotype than in others. (Figure 3A).
Additionally, an interaction between rTMS intervention and
RS4680 genotype was found to have effects on HAMA (H =
4.645, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.14) and HAMD (H = 5.549, p < 0.05,
h2 = 0.17) scores at week 2, suggesting that genotypes may inﬂuence
the outcome of rTMS. Regarding the RS16965628 genotype, the
analysis results (Table 2) showed that the main effect of rTMS (H =
4.514, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.15) was signiﬁcant for the HAMD Week2
Reduction Rate. The rTMS intervention signiﬁcantly improved
HAMD scores to a greater extent in the active group, regardless
of whether patients had the GC or GG genotype, compared to the
sham group; and the improvement of the HAMD score of patients
carrying the GC genotype are more concentrated than the
improvement of the patients with GG genotype (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, the RS16965628 genotype exerted a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the reduction of HAMD scores (H = 6.361, p < 0.05,
h2 = 0.20), with patients carrying the GG genotype showing greater
improvement compared to C allele carriers (Table 4 and Figure 3B).
However, the interaction between intervention type and genotype
did not impact the rate of HAMD score reduction (H = 0.024, p >
0.05) (Table 4). For RS1019385, polymorphism of the gene also
demonstrated a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on HAMA score reduction
(H = 6.057, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.19). Speciﬁcally, individuals with the
CC genotype exhibited greater improvement in HAMA scores
compared to those with other genotypes; and the reduction rate
of the HAMA score are found to be more volatility in AC genotype
carrier (Figure 3C).
Discussion
The present study provides evidence that both SSRIs and rTMS
augmentation of SSRIs led to signiﬁcant improvements in OCD
symptoms following a two-week intervention. Additionally,
polymorphisms of RS4680, RS16965628, and RS1019385, were
found to be associated with treatment response. The study reveals
that individuals with the GG allele of RS4680 (COMT) exhibited a
relatively poorer response in terms of reducing Y-BOCS scores, not
only to SSRIs treatment but also to combined treatment involving
SSRIs and rTMS. This ﬁnding may be attributed to the decreased
susceptibility of patients with the GG allele (RS4680) to rTMS or the
combination treatment. RS4680, also known as Val158Met (G to
A), is closely linked to the risk of OCD (50, 51). It has been
suggested that the Met (A) allele reduces the enzyme activity,
enhances cortical dopamine signaling, and contributes to OCD.
This explanation aligns with the current study’s ﬁnding that
patients with the GG allele of RS4680 lack the A (Met) allele and
are therefore less susceptible to both OCD and its treatments (50).
Regarding the serotonin transporter protein gene (SLC6A4), no
signiﬁcant association was observed between different genotypes
and Y-BOCS scores. However, the C allele at RS16965628 (SLC6A4)
predicted improvements in HAMD scores, indicating that patients
with the C allele may be more responsive to rTMS augmentation

therapy of SSRIs in reducing depressive symptoms. This result
could be said to keep consistent with previous experimental ﬁndings
on the association between the C allele and OCD patients (35, 44),
highlighting the strong connection between serotonin and the
depressive symptoms of OCD patients. The potential bio-marker
of the C allele in RS16965628 in SLC6A4 further supports the
notion proposed by Zhang (33) in 2019 that SLC6A4 could serve as
a candidate gene for the combined treatment of SSRI and rTMS.
Furthermore, the study results indicate that GG allele in RS1019385
signiﬁcantly beneﬁts in reducing HAMA scores, implying that patients
with this speciﬁc genotype may be more susceptible to rTMS
augmentation therapy of SSRIs in alleviating anxiety symptoms. This
ﬁnding might be seen as be supported by Arnold (45) who established a
signiﬁcant association between ACC Glx levels and the GRIN2BRS1019385 polymorphism, with individuals carrying the GG genotype
showing reduced Glx compared to T allele carriers. The G allele of
RS1019385 represents a variant in the promoter region, potentially
leading to decreased transcription and impacting glutamatergic
neurotransmission, thereby possibly contributing to OCD (45–47).
There are several limitations of this study, including a small
sample size, high drop-out rate and a short trial period of two weeks.
These may account for the low effect size of some of the results. These
limitations might have affected the reliability and validity of the
current study. Therefore, future research should include a larger and
more diverse sample size and conduct longer interventions, some
better welfare might be provided to minimize withdrawal rates.
In conclusion, the A allele of COMT RS4680, the C allele of
SLC6A4 RS16965628, and the GG allele of GRIN2B RS1019385 may
serve as bio-markers for the combined treatment of rTMS and
SSRIs in OCD, inﬂuencing Y-BOCS, HAMD, and HAMA scores,
respectively. Due to limitations in sample size and trial duration,
further research is needed to validate these ﬁndings. The ﬁndings of
this study provide valuable insights for further investigation and the
implementation of precision treatment for OCD.

Background: Severe pneumonia due to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) is
a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Noninfectious respiratory
syndromes resembling LRTIs can complicate the diagnosis and may also make
targeted therapy difﬁcult because of the difﬁculty of identifying LRTI pathogens. In
the present study, a highly sensitive metagenomic next-generation sequencing
(mNGS) approach was used to characterize the microbiome of bronchoalveolar
lavage ﬂuid (BALF) in children with severe lower pneumonia and identify
pathogenic microorganisms that may cause severe pneumonia. The purpose of
this study was to use mNGS to explore the potential microbiomes of children with
severe pneumonia in a PICU.
Methods: We enrolled patients meeting diagnostic criteria for severe pneumonia
admitted at PICU of the Children’s Hospital of Fudan University, China, from
February 2018 to February 2020. In total, 126 BALF samples were collected, and
mNGS was performed at the DNA and/or RNA level. The pathogenic
microorganisms in BALF were identiﬁed and correlated with serological
inﬂammatory indicators, lymphocyte subtypes, and clinical symptoms.
Results: mNGS of BALF identiﬁed potentially pathogenic bacteria in children with
severe pneumonia in the PICU. An increased BALF bacterial diversity index was
positively correlated with serum inﬂammatory indicators and lymphocyte
subtypes. Children with severe pneumonia in the PICU had the potential for
coinfection with viruses including Epstein–Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and
Human betaherpesvirus 6B, the abundance of which was positively correlated
with immunodeﬁciency and pneumonia severity, suggesting that the virus may be
reactivated in children in the PICU. There was also the potential for coinfection
with fungal pathogens including Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus
in children with severe pneumonia in the PICU, and an increase in potentially
pathogenic eukaryotic diversity in BALF was positively associated with the
occurrence of death and sepsis.

Conclusions: mNGS can be used for clinical microbiological testing of BALF samples
from children in the PICU. Bacterial combined with viral or fungal infections may be
present in the BALF of patients with severe pneumonia in the PICU. Viral or fungal
infections are associated with greater disease severity and death.

Importance
During the COVID-19 pandemic, metagenomic next-generation
sequencing (mNGS) of children admitted to the pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) with severe pneumonia has been an effective way to
rapidly identify potentially pathogenic novel microorganisms.
In this retrospective study of bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid samples
from 126 children in the PICU, pathogenic microorganisms
associated with severe pneumonia were identiﬁed by mNGS.
Pathogenic bacteria may be combined with viruses such as
Epstein–Barr virus and Cytomegalovirus, and possibly fungi such as
Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus, in the
bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid of children with severe pneumonia
admitted to the PICU.
Background
The global COVID-19 pandemic is now in its third year. Even
without COVID-19, however, pneumonia causes more deaths each
year than any other type of infectious disease (Hansen et al., 2016).
Accurate detection of pathogens and differentiation from background
commensal organisms is essential to guide optimal antimicrobial
therapy. Bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid (BALF) is considered a
specimen suitable for the detection of pathogens involved in
respiratory tract infections (Friaza et al., 2010; Charlson et al., 2012;
Willner et al., 2013; Seo et al., 2015). Metagenomic next-generation
sequencing (mNGS) can be used to assess the microbial composition
of clinical samples without culture, improving the sensitivity of
pathogen detection and providing guidance for clinical practice (Gu
et al., 2019). mNGS of BALF samples can identify pathogenic agents
and improve treatment precision. Leo et al. (Leo et al., 2017) found
that a protocol based on sequential lysis of human and bacterial cells
or mechanical disruption of all cells could be used to extract DNA
from BALF samples and perform mNGS assays. Fang et al. (Fang
et al., 2018) performed mNGS on blood, BALF, and cerebrospinal
ﬂuid samples from an adult patient with severe pneumonia with
unexplained fever and subsequent encephalitis, and they detected
high loads of human adenovirus B55. The patient was treated with
intravenous ribavirin and cleared the virus after 26 days, and mNGS
testing was performed to diagnose unexpected herpes simplex virus 1
encephalitis during hospitalization, leading to timely treatment (Fang
et al., 2018). Qi et al. (Qi et al., 2019) used mNGS on BALF samples
from hospitalized patients with suspected ventilator-associated
pneumonia. mNGS detected new pathogens in addition to those
obtained by culture methods, while potential pathogens, including
bacterial, fungal, and viral organisms, were detected by mNGS in 89%
(40 of 45) culture-negative samples (Qi et al., 2019). Li et al. (Li et al.,
2020a) performed mNGS on 35 BALF samples from 32 adults with
respiratory failure. They found that the diagnostic sensitivity of
mNGS was 88.89% and speciﬁcity was 74.07% compared with the
culture method, with a concordance rate of 77.78% between the two
methods; additionally, the diagnostic sensitivity of mNGS was 77.78%
and speciﬁcity was 70.00% compared with the smear method and
polymerase chain reaction. The diagnostic sensitivity of the mNGS
ﬁndings led to a change in the treatment strategy in 11 of 32 (34.4%)
patients (Li et al., 2020a).
The results of BALF mNGS testing in patients with severe
respiratory infections have been shown to be similar to those of
transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) and transtracheal aspiration. Liu
et al. (Liu et al., 2019) compared mNGS testing on BALF samples and
TBLB tissue samples from patients with peripheral lung infections.
Whereas the speciﬁcity of mNGS was lower for BALF than for TBLB
tissue, the sensitivity of mNGS was higher for BALF than for TBLB
tissue, and the most common infectious agents of the lung were
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter
baumannii (Liu et al., 2019). Kalantar et al. (Kalantar et al., 2019)
performed mNGS on 52 mini-BALF samples from adults with severe
pneumonia and compared them with mNGS results from tracheal
aspirate samples. They found that although there were signiﬁcant
differences between sample types in patients with non-infectious
acute respiratory disease, there were signiﬁcant similarities in the
composition of samples from patients with bacterial pneumonia,
whose microbial community was characterized as the main
pathogen (Kalantar et al., 2019).
Studies of mNGS on BALF samples from patients with severe
respiratory infections have generally been limited to adults; few
reports have focused on children. Takeuchi et al. (Takeuchi et al.,
2019) performed mNGS on BALF samples from 10 children with
respiratory failure and detected signiﬁcant bacterial or viral
sequencing reads in 8 of the 10 patients. In addition, candidate
pathogens were detected in three patients in whom no pathogens
were identiﬁed by conventional methods. Moreover, the complete
genome of enterovirus D68 was identiﬁed in two patients, and
phylogenetic analysis showed that both strains belonged to subtype
B3, a common strain that has spread worldwide in recent years
(Takeuchi et al., 2019). These ﬁndings indicate that mNGS can be

used for comprehensive molecular diagnosis as well as for pathogen
surveillance in BALF in patients with respiratory tract infections. The
aim of this study was to analyze the microbiome characteristics and
explore the potential pathogens of BALF from pediatric patients with
severe respiratory infection.
Methods
Participant enrollment
The participants in this study were children treated in the pediatric
intensive care unit (PICU) of the Children’s Hospital of Fudan
University from February 2018 to February 2020. The inclusion
criterion was a diagnosis of severe pneumonia according to the
diagnostic criteria established by the World Health Organization
(Bradley et al., 2011; Chisti et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2016). The
primary diagnostic criteria were invasive mechanical ventilation, ﬂuidrefractory shock, an urgent need for noninvasive positive-pressure
ventilation, and hypoxemia requiring an FiO2 greater than the
inhalation concentration or ﬂow rate feasible within general care. The
secondary criteria were an increased respiratory rate, PaO2/FiO2 ratio
of < 250, multilobar inﬁltration, Pediatric Early Warning Score of > 6,
altered mental status, hypotension, presence of effusion, comorbidities
(e.g. immunosuppression, immunodeﬁciency), and unexplained
metabolic acidosis. The exclusion criteria for this study were an age
of < 28 days or > 18 years; noninfectious factors such as congenital
heart disease, pulmonary edema, asthma, upper airway obstruction, or
pulmonary cystic ﬁbrosis; contraindications to ﬁberoptic
bronchoscopy; severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction; and coagulopathy.
BALF collection
With reference to the recommendations of the European
Respiratory Society (de Blic et al., 2000), sedation and topical
anesthesia were administered, and the patient’s lungs were lavaged
using an age-appropriate pediatric ﬂexible ﬁberoptic bronchoscope.
The more severely diseased region in patients with diffuse lung disease
or the right middle lobe was selected based on radiological ﬁndings or
evidence from bronchoscopy. Warm saline (1 mL/kg body weight,
maximum 20 mL per fraction) was dripped into the selected lung
lobes, and at least 40% of the ﬂuid was recovered by mechanical
suction using a pressure of approximately 50 to 100 mmHg.
Serum inﬂammatory markers
Venous blood (2 mL) was collected and stored at room
temperature with heparin anticoagulation to complete the assay for
serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive
protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and other indices. The speciﬁc
processes are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.
Lymphocyte subsets
Venous blood (2 mL) was collected, and the peripheral blood
lymphocyte subsets were ﬁrst labeled with ﬂuorescently labeled
monoclonal antibodies. B cells (CD19+), total T cells (CD3+), CD8+
T cells (CD3+CD8+), CD4+ T cells (CD3+CD4+), and natural killer
cells (CD16+CD56+). Cells were stained in 6-color TBNK Reagent
(BD Multitest) that included CD3-FITC, CD16/CD56-PE, CD45PerCP-Cy5.5, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD19-APC, and CD8-APC-Cy7. Flow
cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was then performed
to complete the lymphocyte subpopulation analysis.
Clinical microbiology testing
Microbiological culture
BALF was inoculated in blood agar, chocolate agar, and
MacConkey agar plates; placed in a 5% to 10% carbon dioxide
environment; and incubated at 35°C for 24 to 48 hours. Fungal
culture required two temperatures of 28°C and 35°C with a 5- to 7day incubation period, during which bacterial or fungal growth on the
plate was observed daily. Initial determination of speciﬁc
microorganisms was performed based on the different colony
morphologies and staining on the medium.
Mass spectrometry
Suspicious colonies on the medium were selected for further
identiﬁcation of bacterial or fungal taxa by matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry.
Drug sensitivity testing
For suspected growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae, suspicious
colonies on the blood agar plate were selected for further puriﬁcation.
The optochin test was performed for identiﬁcation and drug
sensitivity testing of microorganisms such as Escherichia coli strains
ATCC25922, ATCC35218, ATCC25923, ATCC27853, ATCC29213,
ATCC29212, ATCC49619, ATCC66027, and ATCC49766. The drug
sensitivity test was performed at Shanghai Clinical Laboratory Centre.
Detection of common respiratory viruses
Common respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus,
adenoviruses, inﬂuenza A and B, parainﬂuenza virus, and human
metapneumovirus were detected using an immunoﬂuorescence test
kit (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, USA). The procedure is detailed
in the Supplementary Appendix.
mNGS
We performed metagenomic sequencing with reference to our
previously published studies (Wang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020; Wang
et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019), as
described in the Supplementary Appendix.

Metagenomics analysis
Microbial ecological diversity
The sequencing data from each sample were ﬁrst normalized to
obtain the number of sequenced reads of individual microorganisms
out of 1 million total sequenced reads [i.e., reads per million (rpm)].
The microbial ecological diversity index of the sample was then
calculated based on the rpm value of each microorganism in the
sample, including the abundance (i.e. the sum of rpm of all
microorganisms), number of species, and alpha diversity index
(Chao1 diversity index and Shannon diversity index). The Chao1
diversity index and Shannon diversity index were calculated using the
vegan package of R software (version 3.6.1).
Determination of pathogenic microorganisms
We referred to a previously published article (Yan et al., 2021) for
the determination of pathogenic microorganisms in BALF, as
described in the Supplementary Appendix.
Correlation/regression analysis
Pearson correlation coefﬁcients and Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients for each microbial ecological diversity index and clinical
phenotype were ﬁrst calculated by the cor.test() function of R software
(version 3.6.5). Next, the lm() function of R software (version 3.6.5)
was used to perform a linear ﬁt of the microbial ecological diversity
index to the clinical phenotypes, was then the ggplot2 package of R
software was used to draw the scatterplot. Statistically signiﬁcant pvalues were obtained by the Wilcoxon rank sum test function
(wilcox.test) of R software.
Results
Clinical information
This study involved 126 children in the PICU, including 84 with
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 42 with hospital-acquired
pneumonia (HAP). Their mean maximum body temperature was 39°C
± 0.95°C, mean heart rate was 160 ± 19 beats per minute, mean total
duration of hospitalization was 37 ± 29 days, and mean number of days
in the PICU was 30 ± 29 days. The 30-day mortality analysis revealed
24 deaths and 16 cases of abandoned treatment, accounting for 29.4%
of all patients. In total, 86.5% (109/126) of patients had combined
respiratory failure, 24.6% (31/126) had combined severe pneumonia,
24.6% (31/126) had combined sepsis, 5.5% (7/126) had septic shock,
one had encephalitis, and four were being hospitalized after cord blood
stem cell transplantation.
The mean serum CRP concentration was 67 ± 56 mg/L, PCT
concentration was 8.9 ± 19 ng/mL, LPS concentration was 1.0 ± 7.6
pg/mL, and IL-6 concentration was 390 ± 850 pg/mL. The white
blood cell (WBC) count was 18 ± 12 × 109 cells/L, CD3+ lymphocyte
count was 1.2 ± 1.3 × 109 cells/L, CD4+ T cell count was 6.8 ± 8.7 ×
108 cells/L, CD8+ T cell count was 5.0 ± 5.9 × 108 cells/L, and NK cell
count was 1.4 ± 1.8 × 108 cells/L. Pathogenic microorganisms were
detected in 81 patients based on conventional clinical microbiological
testing methods such as blood and other cultures.
Use of mNGS of BALF samples to identify
pathogenic microorganisms associated with
clinical symptoms
mNGS was performed on 126 samples [at the DNA level in most
(101/126, 80.1%) and at the RNA level in a smaller number (25/126,
19.8%)]. Each sample sequenced yielded 2.6 ± 1.4 × 107 clean
sequences. The potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the samples
were further identiﬁed by considering both the relative abundance of
the microorganisms in the samples to be tested and the outlier levels (zscore) in all samples, following the method used in our previous study
(Yan et al., 2021). The relative abundance and z-score distribution of
the pathogenic microorganisms obtained are shown in Figure 1.
Nucleic acid sequences of 88 pathogenic bacteria were detected,
including 9 species of Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae,
Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus mitis,
Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus
salivarius), 7 species of Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus aureus,
Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus
haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
and Staphylococcus warneri), and 3 species of Acinetobacter
(Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter johnsonii, and
Acinetobacter nosocomialis). The top 25 bacteria are listed in
Figure 2. In total, 13 viral nucleic acid sequences were detected,
including 4 human herpesviruses [Human alphaherpesvirus 1,
Human betaherpesvirus 5 (also known as human cytomegalovirus),
Human betaherpesvirus 6B, and Human gammaherpesvirus 4 (also
known as Epstein–Barr virus)], Human mastadenovirus B, and
Human polyomavirus 4. All viruses are shown in Supplementary
Figure 1. Nucleic acid sequences were detected for 39 pathogenic
fungi, including 4 Aspergillus species (Aspergillus ﬁscheri, Aspergillus
fumigatus, Aspergillus mulundensis, and Aspergillus nidulans) and
Pneumocystis jirovecii; the other fungi are shown in Supplementary
Figure 2. Nucleic acid sequences were detected for 27 protozoans,
including 10 protozoa of the genus Plasmodium (Plasmodium
falciparum, Plasmodium gaboni, Plasmodium gallinaceum,
Plasmodium gonderi, Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium malariae,
Plasmodium reichenowi, Plasmodium relictum, Plasmodium sp, and
Plasmodium yoelii) and 2 protozoa of the genus Trypanosoma
(Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma theileri). The others are
speciﬁed in Supplementary Figure 3.

inﬂammatory indicators
We found that the serum LPS concentration was correlated with
the pathogenic bacterial abundance in BALF. Notably, most of the 12
serum LPS-associated bacteria identiﬁed were positively correlated
with the serum LPS concentration, including Acinetobacter
baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria subﬂava, Pseudomonas

aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Mycoplasma salivarium,
and several others; the full results are shown in Figure 3A. We also
found that the serum CRP concentration was correlated with the
pathogenic bacterial abundance in BALF, with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Corynebacterium striatum positively correlated with
the serum CRP concentration, as shown in Figure 3B. Moreover, the
serum PCT concentration was correlated with the abundance of
pathogenic bacteria in BALF; the abundance of Staphylococcus
aureus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycoplasma
salivarium was positively correlated with the serum PCT
concentrations, as shown in Figure 3C. Likewise, we found that
serum IL-6 concentration was correlated with the abundance of
pathogenic bacteria in BALF, with positive correlations noted for
Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter nosocomialis. Notably,
we found that certain Streptococcus spp. Pathogenic bacteria in BALF,
such as Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae,
Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mitis, were negatively
correlated with the serum IL-6 concentration, as shown in Figure 3D.
Correlation of pathogenic microbial
abundance in BALF with total WBC count
and T-lymphocyte count
The data showed that the total WBC count was negatively correlated
with the abundance of pathogenic bacteria in BALF, such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Prevotella jejuni, Streptococcus australis,
Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Sphingopyxis fribergensis, Actinomyces
pacaensis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Herbaspirillum huttiense, and others
(Supplementary Figure 4A). We also found that the total WBC count was
negatively correlated with the abundance of Human betaherpesvirus 6B
and Human gammaherpesvirus 4 in BALF (Supplementary Figure 4B)
and with the abundance of fungi in BALF such as Pneumocystis jirovecii
and Aspergillus terreus (Supplementary Figure 4C).
Total T cell count was correlated with the abundance of pathogenic
bacteria in BALF such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus warneri (Supplementary Figure 5A).
Notably, we found that the abundance of Staphylococcus aureus,
Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus warneri in BALF was
negatively correlated with the counts of blood CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell,
and NK cell (Supplementary Figures 5B–D).
Differences in microbiological composition
of BALF between patients with CAP and HAP
We performed a differential analysis of the pathogenic microbial
composition of BALF in patients with CAP and HAP and found 3
pathogenic bacteria that were present at signiﬁcantly different levels.
There were signiﬁcantly greater amounts of Acinetobacter baumannii
and Streptococcus miti in patients with HAP than that in patients with
CAP, while the amount of Schaalia_odontolytica was signiﬁcantly
lower in the patients with HAP than that in the patients with CAP.

We also found a signiﬁcantly higher amount of the potentially
pathogenic fungus Diplodia corticola and the potentially pathogenic
parasite Plasmopara halstedii in the BALF of patients with HAP than
of patients with CAP (Figure 4).
Correlation of mortality and oxygenation
index of severe pneumonia with pathogenic
microbial composition of BALF
We assessed the correlation between lethal phenotypes (death or
abandonment of treatment) and the ecological diversity of pathogenic
microorganisms in BALF. The results showed that the fungal and
protozoa richness (Chao1 index) was signiﬁcantly higher in BALF from
deceased than non-deceased patients (Figure 5A); the fungal and protozoal
diversity (Shannon index) was also signiﬁcantly higher in BALF from
deceased than non-deceased patients (Figures 5B, C). We also assessed the
correlation between lethal phenotypes (death or abandonment of
treatment) and the pathogenic microbial composition of the BALF. The
results showed that Escherichia coli abundance was signiﬁcantly higher in
the BALF from deceased than non-deceased patients. Notably, we found
signiﬁcantly higher abundance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and
Corynebacterium segmentosum in the BALF of patients in the

(Figure 5D). Additionally, there was a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of
Pneumocystis jirovecii in the BALF of deceased patients than in both the
non-deceased and abandoned treatment groups (Figure 5E).
OI reﬂects the severity of disease in patients with severe
pneumonia. The data showed that OI was associated with increased
abundance of pathogenic bacteria in BALF, including Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus
aureus (Figure 6A). Moreover, The OI was positively correlated with
an increased abundance of the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and
Rhizopus microspores in BALF (Figure 6B) and with an increased
abundance of the viruses Human mastadenovirus B and Torque teno
virus 29 in BALF (Figure 6C). In addition, there was a weak positive
correlation between OI and the overall viral abundance (Figure 6D).
Sepsis and immunodeﬁciency in patients
with severe pneumonia associated with
BALF microorganisms
Among patients with severe pneumonia, the BALF fungal and
parasite species richness (Chao1 index), Shannon diversity, and
number of species were signiﬁcantly higher in patients with than
without sepsis (Supplementary Figure 6). Additionally, the total
number of bacterial species in BALF was signiﬁcantly higher in
patients with than without immunodeﬁciency (Supplementary
Figure 7A). Moreover, the abundance of Elizabethkingia anophelis
in BALF was signiﬁcantly higher in patients with than without
immunodeﬁciency (Supplementary Figure 7B). Notably, we found
that the abundance of Human betaherpesvirus 5 (i.e., human
cytomegalovirus) in BALF was signiﬁcantly higher in patients with
than without immunodeﬁciency (Supplementary Figure 7C).
Discussion
In this retrospective study, we included 126 BALF samples from
children with severe pneumonia admitted to the PICU with the aim of
exploring the potential microbiome composition. As for mNGS-based
pathogen identiﬁcation and aiding clinical decision-making, this is a
challenging task. In this study, although all BALF samples were
completed with mNGS testing, the turnaround time for performing
mNGS testing from early 2018 to early 2020 was several days or even a
week, with most samples being taken at 48-72 hours. Also,
considering that the condition of PICU patients is rapidly changing;
So we did not wait for mNGS results to start clinical decision-making.
Instead, we refer to the results of conventional clinical immunological
and microbiological testing methods such as lymphocyte subtypes,
inﬂammatory factor markers, and pathogenic microbial cultures for
initial determination of pathogenic infection and clinical decisionmaking. Happily, it is now possible to obtain mNGS results in less
than 24 hours and to guide clinical decision making based on mNGS
in our hospital.
This aim of the present study is to resolve the microbiome
composition of BALF from children with severe pneumonia in
PICU by mNGS technique and to identify some microbiome
features associated with clinical indicators. The mNGS performed
on BALF samples facilitates the rapid identiﬁcation of pathogens of
critical illnesses. However, as with traditional interpretation of
metagenomic data, the interpretation of mNGS results is
challenging. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the
microbiome composition of BALF, we performed a comprehensive
assessment of microbial composition in BALF according to four
pathogenic microbial communities: bacterial, viral, fungal, and
protozoan, with reference to traditional metagenomic data analysis
methods. By correlating microbial ecological diversity indicators, high

abundance of pathogenic microorganisms with conventional clinical
indicators such as lymphocyte subtypes, inﬂammatory markers, etc.,
some indicative microecological indicators or pathogenic
microorganisms associated with disease were identiﬁed.
Correlation of abundance of
potentially pathogenic bacteria in BALF
with serum inﬂammatory markers and
lymphocyte subtypes
In the present study, we found that the BALF bacterial diversity
indices, including the Chao1 diversity index and overall abundance,
were positively correlated with the serum LPS concentration; the
bacterial species count was positively correlated with the serum PCT
concentration; and that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa abundance in
BALF was positively correlated with the serum LPS, CRP, and PCT
concentrations and negatively correlated with the whole blood WBC
count and CD4+ T cell count.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a conditionally pathogenic bacterium
widely present in nature, human skin, intestine, and respiratory tract;
studies have shown that P. aeruginosa is an important causative agent of
hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated
pneumonia (VAP) (Pang et al., 2019); notably, P. aeruginosa is prone
to cause intranasal and ventilator-associated pneumonia in
immunocompromised and hospitalized patients (Killough et al.,
2022). Consistent with this, we found that P. aeruginosa abundance in
BALF was negatively correlated with whole blood WBC counts and
CD4+ T cell counts; also, in this study, we found that the number of
bacterial species detected in BALF was elevated in the immunodeﬁcient
group relative to the non-immunodeﬁcient group (Supplementary
Figure 7A). In short, this implies that the rise in the abundance of P.
aeruginosa may be associated with immunocompromised or impaired
immunity in patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common

multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium and a common cause of
ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients in ICUs. Ventilatorassociated pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is
characterized by high morbidity and mortality (Zhuo et al., 2008;
Valencia and Torres, 2009). Experimental models suggest that
ventilator-induced lung injury is associated with increased bronchial
vascular permeability in BALF, higher cell counts and protein
concentrations, and increased inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells into
lung tissue (Wolters et al., 2009). Cytokines are small proteins that
communicate through intercellular signaling and can be considered
immunomodulators of immune and inﬂammatory responses (Spelman
et al., 2006). Human studies have shown that cytokine/chemokine
release and leukocyte recruitment contribute to ventilator-associated
lung injury (Halbertsma et al., 2005) and that IL-6, an inﬂammatory
marker of ventilator-associated lung injury, may contribute to alveolar
barrier dysfunction in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(Wolters et al., 2009). IL-6 is an important pro-inﬂammatory cytokine
that is released during infection or tissue injury; IL-6 is mainly expressed
by natural immune cells such as monocyte macrophages, but can also be
produced by Th2 cells, vascular endothelial cells, and ﬁbroblasts (Kang
and Kishimoto, 2021). In the present study, we observed a correlation
between serum IL-6 levels and the abundance of speciﬁc pathogenic
microorganisms in BALF (Figure 3D). Tsay et al. found that, like
mechanical ventilation, intranasal perfusion with P. aeruginosa also
induced IL-6 expression in the lungs (Tsay et al., 2016). We did not ﬁnd
a correlation between P. aeruginosa abundance and serum IL-6 levels in
BALF and could not identify the source of serum IL-6.
Acinetobacter baumannii, a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium, is
listed by the World Health Organization as posing the greatest threat to
human health and as being in urgent need of new antibiotics (World
health organization, 2017; Lee et al., 2017). In recent years, isolates of
Acinetobacter baumannii have been recovered from a variety of extrahospital sources (e.g., vegetables, water treatment plants, and ﬁsh and
shrimp farms) in addition to known natural habitats (soil and moist
environments), and the wide range of sources of this bacterium might
explain the occurrence of community-acquired infections (Eveillard
et al., 2013). Acinetobacter baumannii is a serious pathogen involved in
hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections (Dijkshoorn
et al., 2007). Cases of CAP caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are
rare in Europe and the United States (Serota et al., 2018); instead, most
cases of CAP caused by Acinetobacter baumannii occur in countries
with tropical or subtropical climates. Acinetobacter baumannii is an
emerging pathogen in the Asia-Paciﬁc region, with a high prevalence in
Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia (Kim et al., 2018).
In the present study, we found that the abundance of Acinetobacter
baumannii in BALF of children in the PICU was positively correlated
with the serum IL-6 and LPS concentrations. Notably, the abundance of
Acinetobacter baumannii in BALF was signiﬁcantly higher in patients
with HAP than CAP; this may be related to the fact that Acinetobacter
baumannii is more common in hospitals than in the community. The
primary target of Acinetobacter baumannii is patients in ICUs, and the
use of antibiotics has led to outbreaks and epidemics of infections
caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in hospitals
(Dijkshoorn et al., 2007; Ramirez et al., 2020).

Correlation of potentially pathogenic viral
infections in BALF of children in PICU with
immunodeﬁciency and pneumonia severity
Respiratory viral infections are an important cause of pneumonia in
children. Viral bronchiolitis is the most common cause of respiratory
failure in young children requiring invasive ventilation, and coinfections
such as bacterial and fungal infections may prolong and complicate
hospital stays in the PICU (Wiegers et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020b). We
performed mNGS on BALF from children in the PICU and found that
viral nucleic acid sequences were present; in addition, the Chao1 diversity
index of viruses was positively correlated with the maximum body
temperature on admission and negatively correlated with the CD3+
lymphocyte count. As a microbial ecology index, the viral Shannon
diversity index reﬂects both the number of viruses and their abundance.
In calculating the Shannon diversity index of BALF samples, the included
viruses contain both eukaryotic viruses and prokaryotic viruses such as
phages, and usually the number of phage species is more abundant than
eukaryotic viruses. We observed that the Shannon diversity index of
viruses was negatively correlated with the counts of tatol T cell, CD4+ T
cell, CD8+ T cell and NK cell, suggesting whether certain viruses may
have a protective role, such as phages. Considering that phages usually act
as commensal microorganisms and not as pathogenic microorganisms;
therefore, they have not been analyzed and discussed here.
The number of ICU admissions for viral infections is rising. The
Herpesviridae family, including Human gammaherpesvirus 4 (i.e.,
Epstein–Barr virus) and Cytomegalovirus, can be reactivated in ICU
patients, and such viral activation is associated with morbidity and
mortality (Cantan et al., 2019). Consistent with this, we found that the
abundance of Human betaherpesvirus 6B and Human
gammaherpesvirus 4 was negatively correlated with the total WBC
count. Additionally, the abundance of Human betaherpesvirus 5 (i.e.,
human cytomegalovirus) in the BALF of patients with severe
pneumonia was signiﬁcantly higher in those with than without
immunodeﬁciency, suggesting a possible correlation between
immune system dysregulation and viral activation. We also found
that the severity of pneumonia (i.e., the OI) was positively correlated
with the overall viral abundance in the BALF; notably, we found that
the OI was positively correlated with an increase in the abundance of
the viruses Human mastadenovirus B and Torque teno virus 29 in
BALF. In summary, these ﬁndings suggest a correlation between the
viral load in BALF and the severity of pneumonia.
Detection of potentially pathogenic
eukaryotes in BALF of children with severe
pneumonia in the PICU and their association
with death and sepsis
Fungi are another important cause of respiratory infections
(Schmidt et al., 2018). We found signiﬁcantly higher species
richness (Chao1 index), Shannon diversity, and number of species
of pathogenic fungi in the BALF of patients with than without sepsis
in the present study. Aspergillus, Pneumocystis, and Cryptococcus are
the key fungal pathogens known to cause respiratory infections
(Hayes and Denning, 2013). Pneumocystis jirovecii causes
pneumocystis pneumonia, a life-threatening disease in the ICU with
a high mortality rate, particularly in immunocompromised patients
(Salzer et al., 2018; Schmidt et al., 2018). Schmidt et al. (Schmidt et al.,
2018) found that the overall hospital mortality rate was 25.4% and
increased to 58.0% if ICU admission was required. In line with this,
we found a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of Pneumocystis jirovecii in
the BALF of deceased patients than in both non-deceased patients
and patients for whom treatment was abandoned.
Patients in the ICU are more likely to have a history of coinfection
with bacteria and fungi than are patients in the general ward
(Schauwvlieghe et al., 2018). Beumer et al. (Beumer et al., 2019)
found that the incidence of coinfection with bacteria and fungi in the
lungs of patients with inﬂuenza was 55.6% among ICU inpatients,
which was signiﬁcantly higher than in patients in the normal ward
(20.1%), and Aspergillus fumigatus and Pneumocystis jirovecii were
the predominant coinfecting fungi (Beumer et al., 2019). In line with
this, we found that an increase in the abundance of the fungal
pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus in BALF was positively correlated
with the severity (i.e., the OI) of patients with severe pneumonia,
while an increase in the abundance of the bacterial pathogens
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus
aureus in BALF of children in the PICU was also positively correlated
with the severity (i.e., the OI) of patients with severe pneumonia.
Protozoan coinfection increases the risk of pneumonia in children
(D'Acremont et al., 2014; Edwards et al., 2015). We found signiﬁcantly
higher protozoan species richness (Chao1 index), Shannon diversity,
and number of species in the BALF of patients with than without sepsis
in the present study; we also detected nucleic acid sequences of
Plasmodium and Trypanosoma in the BALF of children in the PICU.
Notably, protozoa have a large genome, and the mNGS results only
cover a very small part of their genome. Although in-depth validation is
needed, our results suggest the possibility of protozoan coinfection.
This study aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
microbiome composition in the BALF of children with severe
pneumonia in the PICU. Although uncommon, protozoa such as
parasites may also represent the “potential” pathogenic microbial
composition in BALF (Van den Steen et al., 2010; Deroost et al., 2013;
Wihokhoen et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2022). Therefore, after
metagenomic sequencing, the sequenced reads were aligned to
bacterial, viral, and fungal databases, as well as to protozoan
databases, and the “potential” protozoan composition was obtained.
Considering that the protozoan genome size is larger than that of
bacteria, viruses, and fungi, it is difﬁcult to determine whether
protozoa actually exist with a limited number of reads, but we just
try to understand that the nucleic acid sequence of the parasite was
detected. In the next step, we need to verify the existence of protozoa
by 18S rRNA sequencing technology.
Considering that speciﬁc pathogenic microorganisms were detected
only in a small number of BALF samples; therefore, we did not perform
a correlation/regression analysis of the abundance of speciﬁc
pathogenic microorganisms and clinical indicators, or a multiple
linear regression analysis. Instead, we performed a logistic linear
regression of the microecological diversity indicators with the clinical
indicators, and the results are shown in Figure 6D, where it can be seen
that OI was positively correlated with the abundance of pathogenic
bacteria in BALF. Indeed, the correlation is weaker, but reﬂects a trend.
All patients included in this study were from pediatric intensive
care units; usually, DNA viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma are

the predominant pathogenic microorganisms associated with the
respiratory tract in children, with RNA viruses accounting for a
relatively small proportion. The mNGS used in this study cannot
take into account both DNA and RNA viruses. According to the
clinical empirical judgment of two specialized physicians, 25 of 126
patients were inclined to RNA virus infection, in order to obtain the
test results in the shortest time and save clinical costs. We only tested
the above 25 cases at the RNA level and 121 cases at the DNA level,
and the test results were also consistent with the empirical judgment
results. Of course, the mNGS technique in this study cannot take into
account both DNA and RNA viruses, and there may be missed
detection. Nowadays, our team has developed the mNGS pathogen
capture technique based on mNGS, and the development of this
technique will make up for this deﬁciency and provide a new direction
of choice for pathogenic diagnosis in line with clinical thinking.
This study had some limitations. The inﬂammatory marker testing
using BALF samples can provide direct insight into the impact of different
pathogenic infections on pneumonia outcomes. However, since the
volume of BALF obtained from children is limited; therefore, BALF
samples were not used for inﬂammatory marker assays in addition to
pathogenic assays; as an alternative strategy, we performed inﬂammatory
marker assays on blood samples. The pathogenic nucleic acid sequences
we identiﬁed in BALF in the PICU require in-depth validation, including
completion by clinical microbiological methods such as BALF culture and
antibody testing. Further, multicenter scale-up validation is also needed
for an in-depth assessment of mNGS results relevance to clinical
symptoms in children with severe pneumonia in the PICU.
Conclusions
mNGS of BALF from children with severe pneumonia in the PICU
revealed potentially pathogenic bacterial infections. The increased
bacterial Chao1 diversity index and overall abundance in the BALF
were positively correlated with serum inﬂammatory indicators, and
altered abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria was correlated
with serum inﬂammatory indicators and altered lymphocyte subtypes.
In addition, there was the potential for coinfection with viruses in these
children as shown by the correlation of the abundance of potentially
pathogenic viruses in BALF with the presence of immunodeﬁciency
and the severity of pneumonia. We also found the potential for fungal
coinfections in these children as indicated by the positive association of
increased diversity of potentially pathogenic fungi in BALF with the
occurrence of death and sepsis.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently display intensely repetitive,
restricted thoughts, and behaviors. These behaviors have similarities to compulsions
and/or obsessions in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and are primarily treated
with behaviourally-based interventions and serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Due to
the lack of treatment responses in many cases, however, new treatments are being
sought. Here we report beneﬁcial effects of treatment with liraglutide, a glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, on severe obsessive food craving, binge eating, weight gain,
and behavioral problems in an adolescent male with infantile autism and moderate
intellectual impairment. Liraglutide treatment reduced weight and unwanted behavior
seemingly by preventing food-related repetitive thoughts and compulsions. Our report
provides clinical evidence that GLP-1 signaling pathway may represent a novel target for
treating food-related behavioral problems and aggressive behavior in ASD.

and odd in context represent some of the core diagnostic features in autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) and associate with diﬃculties in interpreting everyday social signals and limited language
and cognitive capabilities in ASD individuals (1). These are analogous to compulsions, which are
driven by repetitive urge to perform the behavior and the tendency to repeat repetitive actions
in a stereotyped or habitual manner (2). Voluntary control of compulsions is limited and the
ability to delay or inhibit behaviors is diminished. Compulsions can signiﬁcantly disturb the daily
life and provoke far-reaching behavioral and functional problems. Obsessive compulsive disorder
(OCD) is characterized by compulsions and/or obsessions that cause functional impairment (3).
Rewarding eﬀects followed by reduced anxiety caused by obsession link compulsion in OCD to
behavioral addiction.
Diﬀerentiating RRBs of ASD from the obsessions and compulsions in OCD is challenging
because of the heterogeneity of symptom manifestation and remarkable comorbidity characterizing
both disorders. Particularly high-functioning persons with ASD have an elevated risk for OCD and
co-occuring substance abuse (4). The high comorbidity and shared familial risks suggest that ASD
and OCD-spectrum disorders have partially overlapping etiological mechanisms (5). Both ASD and

OCD involve behavioral symptoms combined with cognitive
manifestations (obsessions in OCD and insistence on sameness
and preoccupations in ASD), which are presumed to be
underpinned by anxiety, compromised executive functioning,
and sensory phenomena. However, unlike in OCD, these
behaviors often appear pleasurable and self-soothing in ASD,
and the individuals may even behave aggressively if they are
obstructed while performing the activities (5).
Cognitive behavioral therapy and serotonin uptake inhibitors
(SRIs) are the ﬁrst-line treatment for OCD (6). In the
realm of pharmacological treatments for OCD symptoms
in ASD, selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have
been reported to be beneﬁcial (7). However, there is some
evidence that individuals with ASD appear to be particularly
sensitive to behavioral activation side eﬀects of SSRIs (6).
Antipsychotics provide therapeutic beneﬁt for a subgroup
of ASD individuals (8) but antipsychotic drugs also are
disadvantaged by many side eﬀects, including increased appetite,
weight gain, and a subsequent increase in body mass index.
Since treatment resistance OCD symptoms are common, several
other treatment strategies have been tested. Abnormalities
identiﬁed in glutamatergic neurotransmission in OCD have
led to clinical trials with “glutamate-modulating” drugs (9).
In this line of studies anti-convulsive drugs (topiramate
and
lamotrigine),
D-cycloserine,
memantine,
minocycline,
modaﬁnil, N-acetylcysteine, and riluzole have been associated
with beneﬁcial therapeutic eﬀects in OCD but their clinical
utility has not been proven in relatively few studies with partially
inconsistent results.
Food-related obsessions and compulsive overeating represent
some of the landmark characteristics of Prader Willi syndrome
(PWS).
Preliminary
evidence
indicates
that
glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists could be used to treat
defects of satiety responses in this genetically based intellectual
disability syndrome (10–12). Similarly to PWS, both children
and adults with ASD suﬀer more frequently from obesity than
the general population. Here we report beneﬁcial eﬀects of
liraglutide, a human GLP-1 analog, on food-related obsessions
and compulsive eating in a case with a neurodevelopmental
disorder characterized by autistic features. No adverse side eﬀects
of liraglutide were observed in our study/patient case.
CASE REPORT
A 20-year-old Finnish male patient is the second-born child
of healthy, non-consanguineous parents with an unremarkable
family history. His close relatives had no manifestations of
thyroid or heritable endocrine diseases. The perinatal period
was uneventful, however, deﬁcits in eye contact behavior
were noted from early infancy onwards. By the preschool
age, he demonstrated behavioral diﬃculties resembling those
associated with autism, including perseveration and impairments
in social interactive behavior including avoidance of strangers.
Abnormal responses to auditory, olfactory, and oral sensory
stimuli were noted. Motor and phonic tics as well as obsessions
appeared in adolescence being periodically severe. At the
age of 6;9 years, the patient received the diagnoses of
pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise speciﬁed and
mild intellectual impairment, with these later, at the age of 11;2
years, having been modiﬁed to infantile autism and moderate
intellectual impairment. Behavioral problems included aggressive
behavior, which resulted in treatment with risperidone being
initiated at the age of 12 years. Initially the antipsychotic
slightly appeared to reduce behavioral diﬃculties while at the
same time resulting in rapid weight gain and nightmares.
Within 6 months, risperidone was substituted with aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole caused initially fatigue, muscular spasms of jaw,
and slurring of speech at the dose of 5 mg/day. After a break
for several months, aripiprazole treatment was continued and
the dose was slowly increased to 7.5 mg/day. Agitation and
disturbing daily RRBs such as switching on and oﬀa water tap,
checking, and jumping led to the combining of citalopram to the
medication at the age of 14;10 years. Nevertheless, the gradually
increased dose of citalopram to 20 mg/day did not improve
the situation and especially food-related obsessions and constant
weight gain appeared problematic. Craving of food, particularly
sweet drinks, led the patient to e.g., steal food. A temporary
increase in alanine transferase (ALT; 77 U/L, reference range <40
U/L) together with a slight decrease in thyroxin (T4) levels (11
pmol/L, reference range 12–20 pmol/L) were observed. In the
laboratory tests prior to commencing the liraglutide treatment,
ALT was diminished (56 U/L), γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT)
normal (<50 U/L), serum TSH 1.3 mU/L (reference range 0.2–
4.2 mU/L) with the values for lipid metabolism, blood count,
creatinine, and fasting glucose being within the normal range.
In metabolic screening, urine amino acids, oligosaccharides, and
glycosaminoglycans were within the normal range, similarly EEG
was normal. Further, karyotyping and fragile X studies resulted
in normal ﬁndings. Ophthalmological examination revealed
hyperopia (+5.0/+5.0) that was treated with glasses. Hearing was
normal in the otoacoustic emissions test.
Within
the
cognitive
domain,
the
patient’s
cognitive
functioning was commensurate with the level of moderate
intellectual impairment (full scale intelligence quotient 43) at
the age of 19;3 years. His verbal comprehension, perceptual
reasoning, and processing speed indices were at the very poor
level (50, 50, and 64, respectively), with the working memory
index being slightly better (71). In terms of memory, rote
learning and digit span were within the normal range with
all other functions being notably compromised. His level of
autistic symptoms as assessed across lifespan were signiﬁcantly
elevated
(Social
Communication
Questionnaire
life-time
version score 24). Similarly, his level of social functioning
was moderately impaired (Social Responsiveness Scale T-score
69, with most pronounced deﬁcits seen in social cognition
and autistic mannerisms). In the Strengths and Diﬃculties
Questionnaire as responded by parents, hyperactivity and
friendship scales resulted in aberrant scores. There were also
signiﬁcant OCD symptoms as assessed by the OCI-R (29 points).
In terms of adaptive functioning, results from the Vineland-II
Adaptive Behavior Scales at the age of 19;3 years indicated
a low level of functioning overall, with the following mental
age equivalents for subdomains: receptive communication

relationships 3;10, play and leisure time 4;7, coping skills 7;1.
In addition, both internalizing and externalizing maladaptive
behaviors were at a clinically signiﬁcant level. In childhood, the
patient’s rehabilitation has included both speech therapy and
occupational therapy.
Treatment with liraglutide was initiated with a dose of 0.6
mg/day and being gradually increased to 2.4 mg/day during the
following 8 weeks. Immediate positive response was observed
in the patient’s food-related behavior manifesting as drastically
subsided obsessive food-related thoughts, craving for food, and
compulsive eating. After ﬁrst week of treatment, a clear reduction
in patient’s body weight was seen (Figure 1). Also obsessions,
compulsions and behavioral problems not related to food,
including aggressive behavior, decreased in a signiﬁcant way at
home. The treatment was continued 36-weeks with the dose
2.4 mg/day. At the time-point 8 weeks, the weight was already
reduced by 6%. From week 25 to the end of the follow-up the
weight reduction settled at 12–13%. In the laboratory control at
8 weeks, the standardized oral glucose tolerance test was normal
(glucose 5.3 and 4.6 mmol/L before and 120-min after the glucose
administration, respectively). In later control fasting glucose and
insulin levels were normal. No adverse side eﬀects of liraglutide
were observed in our patient case.
DISCUSSION
Relevance of the ability of GPL-1 to promote satiety and reduce
food intake in connection with compulsive eating behavior has
recently attracted attention [see review of GLP-1 (13)]. GLP-1
belongs to the group of gut-derived peptide hormones referred
to as incretins, which are released in response to oral intake
of nutrients. Native GLP-1 is rapidly degraded in circulation,
and therefore, long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists have been
developed, allowing once daily to once weekly administration as
subcutaneous injection. GLP-1 agonists have been shown to be
eﬀective in the pharmacotherapy of obesity and type 2 diabetes
(14). In the current study, we found that liraglutide remedied
food-related obsessions and related disruptive behavior in our
patient case with ASD. The patient’s obsessions to food initially
emerged following the treatment with atypical antipsychotics.
Antipsychotic drugs aﬀect several neurotransmitter systems
implicated in both motivational and regulatory aspects of food
intake, insulin release, and glucose metabolism. It has also
been postulated that centrally-mediated vagal eﬀerent activity,
regulated via hypothalamus through repetitive and increased
food ingestion as well as via increased circulating free fatty acids
contribute to the eﬀects of atypical antipsychotics (15). The
rapid weight gain caused by antipsychotics did not associate with
alterations of serum lipids in our patient case, albeit marginal
increases in alanine amino transferase as well as reduced serum
thyroxine concentration during risperidone treatment suggested
some metabolic changes. However, the values had normalized
before the treatment with GLP-1 analog, which was used in
combination with aripiprazole and citalopram. There was no
evidence that liraglutide had an interaction with the patient’s
other medication.
According to the parental reports, the patient case also
demonstrated food-independent RRBs which ﬂuctuated in
severity but appeared daily and very disturbing prior to the onset
of the liraglutide treatment. Notably, liraglutide ameliorated

GLP-1 Targeting in Food-Related Compulsive Behavior
these behaviors as well as antisocial and challenging behavior
that was initially the focus of the treatment with antipsychotics,
suggesting beneﬁcial eﬀects of liraglutide treatment also on
impulse control. The substantial decrease in weight during
liraglutide treatment likely has several underlying causal
mechanisms paralleling results of addiction research describing
compulsive substance use and reward seeking behavior (16).
GLP-1 receptor activation decreases anticipatory food reward
and increases consummatory food reward, which may reduce
cravings for food and prevent overeating, respectively (17). Direct
cognitive-behavioral eﬀects of GLP-1 analog by altering the
reward circuits of the brain have been shown in several addictions
with inherent compulsive substance usage (16). There is evidence
that GLP-1 signaling in hippocampus enhances learning and
memory, as well as plays a role in protecting brain from seizures
and neuronal damage via safeguarding against amyloid-beta
peptide induced cognitive decline (18). It is thus possible that in
our patient case the administration of liraglutide also inﬂuenced
some cognitive processes and altered reward circuits of the
brain in addition to the physiological satiety-promoting eﬀects.
However, the direct eﬀects of liraglutide on cognition were not
measured in our study.
Both ASD and OCD are characterized by poor behavioral
inhibition and executive functioning, which are associated with
dysfunction in cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits (19). GLP-1 is
expressed in a subpopulation of hindbrain neurons, which send
axons to many forebrain regions, including the paraventricular
nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Eﬀects of GLP-1 on feeding
behavior are mediated via GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) in PVN
neurons (20). However, GLP-1R ablation in PVN does not
aﬀect glucose metabolism and the vagus nerve is implicated in
the eﬀects of peripherally administered GLP-1 on food intake
and glycaemia (21). GLP-1Rs are expressed in vagal aﬀerent
neurons which terminate in the lamina propria of the intestinal
mucosa and vagal aﬀerents may transfer the gut GLP-1–derived
signals to the brain and mediate satiating and glucoregulatory
responses. Altogether, neuronal mechanisms that contribute to
the beneﬁcial eﬀects of GLP-1 analog on the behavioral challenges
in ASD remain to be further studied.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The present study points to GLP-1 signaling as a potential target
for treating food-related behavioral problems in intellectual
disability syndromes with ASD. As our ﬁndings are limited
to a single patient case further studies are warranted to
further explore the therapeutic utility of GLP-1 analog in
neuropsychiatric symptoms in a sizeable population and
randomized controlled trials.

Pulmonary diseases of viral origin are often followed by the manifestation of secondary
infections, leading to further clinical complications and negative disease outcomes. Thus,
research on secondary infections is essential. Here, we review clinical data of secondary
bacterial infections developed after the onset of pulmonary viral infections. We review
the most recent clinical data and current knowledge of secondary bacterial infections
and their treatment in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients; case reports from SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 and the best-studied respiratory virus, inﬂuenza, are described.
We outline treatments used or prophylactic measures employed for secondary bacterial
infections. This evaluation includes recent clinical reports of pulmonary viral infections,
including those by COVID-19, that reference secondary infections. Where data was
provided for COVID-19 patients, a mortality rate of 15.2% due to secondary bacterial
infections was observed for patients with pneumonia (41 of 268). Most clinicians treated
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections with prophylactic antibiotics (63.7%, n = 1,901),
compared to 73.5% (n = 3,072) in all clinical reports of viral pneumonia included in this
review. For all cases of viral pneumonia, a mortality rate of 10.9% due to secondary
infections was observed (53 of 482). Most commonly, quinolones, cephalosporins and
macrolides were administered, but also the glycopeptide vancomycin. Several bacterial
pathogens appear to be prevalent as causative agents of secondary infections, including
antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

INTRODUCTION
Viruses causing respiratory tract infections have been the cause of high morbidities
and mortality rates worldwide, often in a seasonal manner for decades (1). In the
last
20
years,
the
world
has
experienced
six
major
outbreaks
of
infectious
agents
(SARS-CoV: 2002-2004; H1N1 Inﬂuenza: 2009–2010; MERS-CoV: 2012–2020; Ebola virus:
2013–2016; Zika virus: 2015–2016; SARS-CoV-2: 2019-present), infection with four of
which (SARS-CoV, H1N1 Inﬂuenza, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) result in respiratory tract
infections. During the emergency of a viral disease, attention is initially focussed on

clinical management of the primary infection, but it is imperative
to consider secondary bacterial infections that develop in patients
during or following initial infection. In addition, co-infections
- the simultaneous infection with a second pathogen of viral
or bacterial origin- can also occur and ultimately result in the
same outcome: The patient suﬀers from complications caused
by two diﬀerent pathogens (2, 3). One major complication of
viral infections, especially pulmonary viruses, is colonization of
the viral aﬀected organs by bacteria which is associated with
high morbidity and mortality rates (Figure 1A), following a
weakened immune response and/or opportunistic and accessible
routes of entry for bacterial pathogen(s) (4). While secondary
bacterial infections or superinfections are largely a consequence
of immune susceptibility caused by the primary viral infection,
co-infections are multiple infections (viral/bacterial/yeast) that
occur simultaneously. Co-infections, secondary infections or
“superinfections” are common during viral pandemics. The 1918
Spanish Flu pandemic saw around 50 million deaths ascribed
to bacterial co-infections and during the 2009 H1N1 Inﬂuenza
pandemic up to 34% of all deaths were a result of bacterial coinfections (5). These complications are often neglected in the
clinical record (Figure 1B) (6, 7).
While the precise mechanism for susceptibility to secondary
infections is poorly understood, it is likely that virus-mediated
immunosuppression
of
the
host
innate
immune
enables
opportunistic bacteria to colonize the host as it was shown for
Streptococcus (8). Most studies on host-pathogen interactions
focus
on
a

model
although
mammalian hosts are simultaneously exposed to multiple
(opportunistic) pathogens (9). The immune response to one

pathogen may alter the immunity to other infectious agent(s),
resulting in increased prevalence of viral-induced secondary
bacterial infections (10). Mammalian cells are more susceptible
to bacterial attachment and colonization when infected by a
virus (11, 12); infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
rhinovirus and inﬂuenza virus (all of which damage the mucosal
layer), lead to bacterial adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, and
bioﬁlm formation on the linings of the airways (13).
Common bacteria isolated during secondary infections
include
Staphylococcus
aureus,
S.
pneumoniae,
Neisseria
meningitides, H. inﬂuenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and members
of the Proteus, Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. (14). During
active viral infections, the route of infection, proximity of
infection as well as virulence factors varies between bacterial
strains resulting in diﬀerent outcomes. Eﬀective treatment of
both the viral and the secondary bacterial infection(s) is of
critical importance. Antiviral treatments deployed initially do
not treat secondary bacterial infections (15). The preferred
treatment for bacterial infections is generally broad-spectrum
antibiotics, but this can result in undesirable side eﬀects that have
a negative impact on the normal microﬂora of the host (16–18).
Susceptible individuals within a population can be protected
from risk of some common bacterial pathogens that are also
capable to cause secondary infections, for example pneumonia, if
vaccines are available; furthermore, the immune system is often
capable of ﬁghting bacterial infections alone, while during a
virus-bacterial infection, the complex immune responses might
be inapt to eliminate bacterial-induced disease complications
(19). To reduce severe disease progression or lethal outcomes,

Secondary Infections During Viral Pneumonia
alternative ways to alleviate complications due to secondary
bacterial infections and to eliminate bacterial pathogens while
preserving host immunity might be necessary.
Secondary infections can also be acquired from the patient’s
environment i.e., hospital-acquired or nosocomial infections.
Nosocomial pathogens are often resistant to a wide range
of antibiotics; a result of increased use of antibiotics and
decades of over- and misuse resulting in selection for multidrug resistant pathogens (MDR pathogens) (20). MDR is
a global problem with >50,000 people per year infected,
of which in ∼25% of the cases no eﬀective antibiotic is
available (21) as many major pharmaceutical stakeholders have
discontinued their search for new chemical antimicrobials (22).
Antibiotic resistant organisms include Methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA), Drug-resistant Streptococcus, Vancomycinresistant Enterococci (VRE), drug-resistant Mycobacterium,
Carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae
(CRE),
Colistinresistant
Klebsiella,
Carbapenem-resistant
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
(20). If a patient with a viral infection is unfortunate to become
infected by MDR bacteria, no standard treatment is currently
available. In one COVID-19 cohort study, described in more
detail below; almost 50% (10 of 21) patients developed secondary
bacterial infections in the lung caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and E. coli, ultimately
leading to their death, despite receiving prophylactic antibiotic
therapy (23).
This evaluation of all the COVID-19 reports available that
reference secondary infections showed that most clinicians
prescribed meropenem and linezolid to children with a rate of
prophylactic treatment between 19.4 and 100.0% (24). In adults
mainly quinolones, cephalosporins and macrolides were used for
treatment with rates of prophylaxis between 13.2 and 100.0%. In
most cases, etiological evidence was not used for therapeutic use
of antibiotics.
In this study, we have assimilated the most recent clinical data
on bacterial secondary infections associated with pneumonias,
caused by pulmonary viruses, including for SARS-CoV-2. We
outline treatments used or prophylactic measures employed
for secondary bacterial infections. This review focuses on
secondary bacterial infections that occur in the respiratory
tissue of patients suﬀering from a viral infection, as most lung
infections by secondary bacterial pathogens remain localized in
the respiratory tract, while a small percentage leads to infections
that spread systematically.
COVID-19 RELATED SECONDARY
BACTERIAL INFECTIONS AND
TREATMENT
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded
RNA virus, belonging to the family Coronaviridae. The virus
emerged in 2019 and is responsible for respiratory illnesses
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that results in respiratory
tract infections and causes severe lung damage in most fatal cases.
SARS-CoV-2 has overwhelmed health systems, with numbers
of those infected with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and
critical care.
Early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection typically include
symptoms of mild fever and shortness of breath (25). As the
virus replicates in the respiratory tract, the symptoms worsen
and once the virus reaches and begins infecting the alveoli, the
host responds by generating inﬂammatory factors in alveolar
tissues that may result in pneumonia. In almost all severe cases,
SARS-CoV-2 infection results in pneumonia and the inﬂamed
ﬂuid-ﬁlled alveolar tissue now is an ideal habitat for bacterial
growth for pathogens including P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The
causative agent resulting in a severe disease progression may be
bacteria, virus or fungi (26).

(Supplemental Data Sheet 1). In particular for data obtained
from clinical observations in China, COVID-19 patients are most
commonly treated with antibiotics (azithromycin, moxiﬂoxacin,
ceftriaxone, vancomycin, cefepime) to reduce the risk of
nosocomial infections, a prophylactic strategy. Should a bacterial
infection occur despite the prophylactic use of antibiotics, caused
by bacteria that are resistant to one or more drugs, diﬀerent
combinations of the same drugs are being used for the treatment,
as a therapeutic strategy. Both strategies, the prophylactic and
the therapeutic use of antibiotics, deploy the same types and
dosage of drugs: however the prophylactic use of antibiotics is
not recommended by most health institutions and governments
around the globe, due to the observed increase in antibiotic
resistance rates, which correlate with the overuse (and misuse)
of antibiotics (28, 29). However, the risk of superinfection

additional
challenges

CASE REPORTS OF ANTIBACTERIAL
THERAPY IN COVID-19 PATIENTS
Fifteen clinical reports, for which data for secondary infections
were available, mainly from hospitals in China, were examined
to provide information of the occurrence, treatment of or
prophylactic measures for bacterial secondary infections during
the course of COVID-19 infections (Supplementary File). A
total of 3,133 COVID-19 patient cases were detailed in the 15
reports (25–39). Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was given to
1,901 of the 2,983 patients (63.7%). We excluded one study
(patient n = 150), as they did not report details on the antibiotic
therapy (31) and 5/14 studies did not report the type of antibiotics
used. The most commonly used antibiotics were moxiﬂoxacin (n
= 452, 39.2%) and azithromycin (n = 294, 30.7%). Others include
ceftriaxone, vancomycin, cefepime, cephalosporins, quinolones,
carbapenems,
tigecycline,
doxycycline,
and
cefoperazone.
In total, 10 studies reported secondary bacterial infections,
with 273 of the 997 patients (27.3%) being infected. Again,

we excluded 5 studies (patients n = 2,136), which did not
report any information on any clinical complications other
than caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (28, 30, 34, 35, 37).
The most common bacterial infections were caused by the
Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus or by strains
of the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. Five
studies reported infections that were conﬁrmed by tests in
a microbiology laboratory, which identiﬁed MRSA, MSSA,
Serratia, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, E. coli, H. inﬂuenza,
and E. cloacae (patients n = 16) (25, 26, 29, 36, 38). Three
studies reported therapeutic antibiotic treatment in 92 of 146
patients (63%), which were administered as secondary bacterial
infections were observed (29, 35, 39). Four studies reported
complications with fatal outcome due to bacterial infections that
included 41 of 268 patients (15.2%) (26, 27, 33, 39). An overview
of the studies can be found in Supplementary Figure 1,

These clinical reports provide insights into the complications
and challenges faced in treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
Patients with pneumonia caused by other respiratory viruses
or SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients were often prophylactically
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, in an attempt to

SARS-RELATED SECONDARY BACTERIAL
INFECTIONS AND TREATMENT
Severe
Acute
Respiratory
Syndrome-related
Coronavirus
(SARS) Co-V, was ﬁrst report in Guangdong Province, China
in November 2002. At its initial outbreak (until August 2003),
8,096 probable cases were reported with an ∼10% fatality rate
(41). Further sporadic cases were reported in November 2003
through April 2004 (42). The case studies showed the occurrence
of bacterial co-infections in the large number of patients. These
include infections by MRSA, Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa and
Streptococcus (43). The large multinucleated cells observed in
the lungs of the SARS patients may be due to the underlining
bacterial infections (43). The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to
cover the secondary bacterial infections is one of the supportive
cares during SARS outbreak (44) (Supplementary File). The
case studies (n = 7) reported the disease progression of a total
of 534 SARS-CoV patients (45–51) (Supplementary File).
Details about prophylactic antibiotic therapy was reported
in ﬁve studies (patients n = 385) and 100% patients were
treated with prophylactic antibiotic therapy (48, 50–53). The
antibiotics used for prophylactic treatment were levoﬂoxacin,
clarithromycin,
amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid,
piperacillintazobactum, maxipime, azithromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate,
cefoperazone/sulbactam,
quinolone
plus
azithromycin,
levoﬂoxacin, moxiﬂoxacin, and ceftriaxone plus azithromycin,
and most commonly azithromycin (n = 206, 74.6%). Of
the four studies that reported secondary bacterial infections,
35 of 306 patients (11.4%) became infected. The pathogens
that caused the infections included P. aeruginosa, MRSA,
S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, Enterococci, Acinetobacter
baumannii, Enterobacter, H. inﬂuenza, S. maltophilia, and
Serratia (45, 47, 49, 51). Despite the deployment of prophylactic
antibiotics, the use of therapeutic antibiotics was reported
in
three
studies,
administering
amoxicillin-clavulanate,
clarithromycin,
azithromycin,
levoﬂoxacin,
moxiﬂoxacin
and ceftriaxone plus azithromycin (47, 49, 51). In total, 12
patients out of 23 (52%, described in two studies who provided
the respective information) had complications due to secondary
bacterial infections (47, 51).
During the 2002 outbreak, most SARS patients were treated
with broad-spectrum antibiotics as a prophylactic therapy.
Contributing factors on antibiotic resistance had not been
fully established by the early 2000’s; however the use of
antibiotics as a precaution in many viral infections and
their potential overuse may have contributed to the current
antibiotic crisis.
MERS-RELATED SECONDARY BACTERIAL
INFECTIONS AND TREATMENT
The ﬁrst cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
CoV epidemic occurred in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia with later
outbreaks observed in 2015 and 2018. To date around 2,519 cases
have been reported from more than 20 countries with a high
fatality rate 34.3% (n = 866), the highest among all coronavirus
diseases (52). The infection often starts as a mild viral respiratory
illness but can rapidly progress to a fatal viral pneumonia mostly
complicated by ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and
ARF (acute renal failure) (53). Due to the high mortality rate
of MERS infections, the impact of the occurrence of bacterial
infections remains unclear as death occurs due to hypoxemia
and bilateral interstitial inﬁltrates in most cases, or ARDS.
Nosocomial bacterial pneumonia is however common among
MERS patients with ventilator support. Therefore, antibiotic
therapy was commonly deployed with secondary bacterial
infections rarely occurring under this treatment regime (53–55).
Here, we review MERS-related case studies, outlining antibiotic
therapies and bacterial infections. A total of 138 MERS-CoV
infected patients were reported (55–59) (Supplementary File).
The use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy was reported in 4
out of 5 studies. Sixty eight patients were treated with the
antibiotics piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin, ceftriaxone
and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, levoﬂoxacin, imipenem
and other broad-spectrum antibiotics (55, 56, 58, 59). The
development of secondary bacterial infection was reported in
two studies, with 32 of 82 patients experiencing complications

due to bacterial pathogens (55, 57). The most common
bacteria were MRSA, while others included carbapenem-resistant
Acinetobacter baumannii, VRE and S. pneumoniae. No detailed
report was provided about treatment antibiotics and one study
reported (patients n = 15) complications due to bacterial
infections in intensive care units (55).
INFLUENZA VIRUSES AND SECONDARY
BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
Inﬂuenza viruses are known to cause seasonal ﬂu every year
and of the four inﬂuenza types, type A and B are known
to cause seasonal epidemics (60). The inﬂuenza A (H1N1)
outbreak in 2009 had even developed into a global pandemic
while causing seasonal ﬂu epidemics each year. In spite of
the availability of vaccines, the global death during the ﬂu
season was estimated to be between 0.25 and 0.5 million people
according to the WHO (61). Secondary bacterial infections are
one of the leading causes for inﬂuenza associated deaths (62).
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), during the 2009 H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic between
29 and 55% of mortalities were due to secondary bacterial
infections (63). The lethal synergism between inﬂuenza virus
and Pneumococcus strains accounts for the majority of diseases
as well as mortality during inﬂuenza epidemics (64). Here, we
summarize case studies that are related to inﬂuenza viruses and
secondary bacterial infections (Supplementary File). Details on
treatment and disease progression of a total of 910 patients
that were infected with inﬂuenza were reported in eight
case studies (65–72). Five studies reported the deployment of
prophylactic antibiotic therapy in 718 of 743 patients (96.6%)
(65–67, 71, 72). The most commonly used antibiotics were
vancomycin (n = 317, 46.2%) and imipenem/meropenem
(n = 243, 54.7%). Others were azithromycin, ceftriaxone,
cephalosporin, piperacillin-tazobactam, linezolid, vancomycin
plus cefepime, vancomycin plus meropenem, clarithromycin,
levoﬂoxacin and dicloxacillin. In total, 223 patients of 910
(24.5%) developed secondary bacterial infections. The infective
agents were S. pneumoniae, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, S. viridians,
S. hominis, Enterococci, H. inﬂuenza, S. pyogenes, S. mitis,
S. agalactiae, Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, Chlamydophila
pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. To treat the infections,
one of the studies reported the use of azithromycin, vancomycin,
ceftriaxone and cephalosporin (65). In general, all eight case
studies reported the treatment complications due to secondary
bacterial infections.
DISCUSSION
The lack of detailed clinical data regarding secondary bacterial
infections following COVID-19, SARS, MERS and inﬂuenza is
surprising. In addition, precise numbers of clinical cases of
COVID-19 or other respiratory virus infections with antibioticresistant secondary bacterial infections are not available.
As globally mortality rates from antibiotic-resistant bacterial
infections are increasing, providing such data of secondary
infection is important, almost critical.
Clinical reports are a valuable source for biomedical scientists
for the advancement of treatment; however, in many cases
crucial data such as medical compounds, their dosage, and
duration of the therapy, is often not reported, similar to
details on patient data or the species of e.g., a pathogenic
bacterium. Such data are essential for the study of secondary
infections in human patients; the scientiﬁc community and
ultimately the patient will beneﬁt when clinicians and nonclinical disease experts work close together. The information
from such collaborative studies can provide a guideline for
treatment. At the same time, the lack of knowledge and
studies that should be done in the future is evident. Reviewing
the available information, it becomes clear that secondary
bacterial infections play a critical role in the morbidity and
mortality rates of patients initially falling ill with pulmonary
viral diseases. Similar to epidemics caused by inﬂuenza viruses,
during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, antibiotic-resistant
bacterial infections are a signiﬁcant threat to the well-being
of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Nosocomial infections
including ventilator-associated infections are often unavoidable
and especially so during a pandemic. The use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics is often a routine preventative measure and until
alternative treatments and to this date unavailable preventive
measures are in place at hospitals, secondary infections will
remain unavoidable due to the nature of nosocomial and
opportunistic pathogens in combination with the rise of
multidrug resistance.
COVID-19 is likely to reappear in populations until a
vaccine is deployed, globally. To prepare for recurrent waves of
COVID-19 disease and the inevitable next new pandemic, new
antibiotics or alternative treatments targeted against secondary
bacterial infections are needed. Alternative therapies such as
Antimicrobial Peptides or Phage Therapy are being explored
and show promise. Most antimicrobial peptides perturb the
structure of the bacterial cell envelope while not aﬀecting the
eukaryotic cell membrane; eventually creating a leaky lipid
bilayer and the collapse of the proton-motif-force, ultimately
resulting in bacterial cell death (73–76). Phage therapy makes
use of bacterial viruses (or bacteriophages) that speciﬁcally infect
bacterial pathogens for viral replication, which leads to the
lysis of the host when phage progeny is being released (77–
83). Anti-virulence compounds are substances that do not kill
or arrest the growth of a bacterial pathogen, but rather target
pathogen-intrinsic components important for the infection
process. These include bacterial components such as exo- and
endotoxins, i.e., actively secreted toxins (e.g., hemolysins) or
cell-inherent structures that are toxic to the patient, such
as LPS, and other factors which facilitate adhesion, invasion
or colonization, but also the escape of the host’s immune
system. Anti-virulence compounds have been demonstrated
to prevent or reduce the severity of symptoms of acute
infections (84, 85).
Pulmonary coronaviruses will likely be a clinical challenge for
many years to come. Viral pandemics from coronaviruses and
emerging pathogens are inevitable in a globalized world with

new avenues to treat bacterial pathogens commonly observed
in secondary infections to avert a healthcare crisis due

Synopsis
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects up to 2.5% of the population of the course of a
lifetime and produces substantial morbidity. Approximately 70% of patients can experience
significant symptomatic relief with appropriate pharmacotherapy. The selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) are the main stay of pharmacological treatment. These are typically used at
higher doses and for longer periods than in depression. Remission is, unfortunately, uncommon.
Proven second-line treatments include the tricyclic clomipramine and the addition of low-dose
neuroleptic medications. Other augmentation strategies have been explored for patients refractory
to proven interventions, but they are not as of yet robustly supported by controlled studies. The
combination of medication with psychotherapy is often used, though careful studies have not
documented synergistic benefit in adult patients. OCD refractory to available treatments remains a
profound clinical challenge.

Introduction
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can present a significant management challenge to
the clinical psychiatrist. OCD affects approximately 1.3% of the population in any given
year, and up to 2.7% over the course of a lifetime [1]. Symptoms consist of obsessions and
compulsions; while either alone suffices for a diagnosis, it is typical for a patient to have
both [2]. Obsessions are repetitive, stereotyped thoughts that cause anxiety or distress. These
are generally experienced as intrusive or ego-dystonic, and they are typically recognized as
unrealistic or excessive; this distinguishes them from delusions, although the distinction can
become unclear in some severe cases. Compulsions are ritualized actions that are undertaken

to mitigate distress, often in response to obsessions. Typical obsessions and compulsions
include preoccupations with contamination accompanied by repeated or ritualized washing,
fear of harm to self or others accompanied by checking rituals, and a need for symmetry or
order, accompanied by ordering or arranging compulsions.
OCD can be treated using pharmacotherapy, specialized psychotherapy, anatomically
targeted treatments, or their combination [3]. First-line treatments include cognitivebehavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs). In this article we review evidence-based pharmacotherapies for OCD, as well as
alternatives that may be considered in refractory patients. Other treatment modalities are
reviewed in other articles in this issue.
Unfortunately, even with optimal treatment, many patients continue to experience
significant symptoms. Remission of moderate or severe OCD is uncommon, and long-term
management is often necessary. The development of new, more effective treatment
interventions represents an urgent clinical need.
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors
The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the mainstay of the pharmacological
treatment of OCD. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine was shown to be of benefit in
the early 1980s [4], but side effects limit its use as a first-line agent. Fluvoxamine was first
shown to be beneficial in individuals with OCD by Goodman and colleagues in 1989 [5].
Since then, more than 20 blinded, placebo-controlled studies have firmly established the
efficacy of SSRI monotherapy in OCD [6, 7]. Because of the combination of proven
efficacy and a typically benign side effect profile, SSRIs are the first-line pharmacological
option for the treatment of OCD [3].
Closer examination of these studies permits several generalizations with respect to the
clinical use of SSRIs for OCD. While fluvoxamine was the first SSRI shown to be
efficacious and is still often thought of (and marketed) as a preferred OCD drug, there is no
evidence of differential benefit among the SSRIs [7]; the choice of agent is therefore best
made on the basis of side effects, drug interactions, patient preference, and similar
considerations.
SSRIs are more efficacious in OCD when used at high doses, in excess of the typical dose
range established by their suppliers (which are generally derived from studies of major
depressive disorder). For example, doses of up to 80 mg of fluoxetine, 40 mg of
escitalopram, 300 mg of fluvoxamine, and 100 mg of paroxetine are often needed;
sometimes even higher doses are used [3]. The benefit of these higher doses has been clearly
shown by a meta-analysis of multiple studies [8]. Interestingly, this contrasts with the use of
the same agents in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), in which higher doses
have been shown to carry a higher side effect burden without increased benefit [9]. OCD
symptoms typically also take longer to respond to SSRI monotherapy than do those of
MDD; an adequate trial is 8–12 weeks [3]. The reasons for these differences between OCD
and MDD response to SSRIs remain unclear.

While these adages – higher dose and longer treatment – are widely accepted by OCD
specialists, their relevance to clinical treatment of individual patients should not be
overstated. The number needed to treat (NNT) for OCD patients treated with SSRI
monotherapy at standard (antidepressant) doses is approximately 5, meaning that if 5
patients are treated with an SSRI, one can be expected to respond who would not have
responded to placebo [7, 8]. The NNT for a dose escalation from a medium dose to the
higher doses noted above is 13–15 [8]. Therefore, while there is clear, measurable benefit to
escalating SSRI dosage, the probability that it will move an individual patient from being a
‘non-responder’ to being a ‘responder’ is modest. There may, however, be smaller but still
clinically meaningful improvements with dose escalation, to which studies are insensitive as
they typically use a categorical definition of treatment response.
With respect to the time to response, the picture is also more complicated than the simple
statement that SSRIs take 8–12 weeks to work. Some patients experience subjective
improvement much more rapidly. A recent meta-analysis examining the trajectory of
symptom improvement, rather than the response rate at endpoint, suggests that benefit
begins in the first weeks of treatment, though it may take many weeks to become clinically
(and statistically) significant in many cases [10]. Therefore, while the observation that SSRI
response is typically slower in OCD than in MDD is correct, the suggestion that there is no
response until after many weeks of treatment is an oversimplification.
Use of the SSRI citalopram merits particular mention. Although it is not approved by the
FDA for use in OCD, citalopram is as efficacious as the SSRIs that are approved [7] and has
historically been frequently used because of its generally good tolerability. However, in
2011, the FDA issued a black-box warning against the use of citalopram doses in excess of
40 mg/day, due to a risk of ECG abnormalities and a theoretical risk of arrhythmia [11].
Doses above 20 mg/day are not recommended in the elderly, and it is recommended that the
drug be avoided altogether in individuals with a QTc of greater than 500 msec or with
conditions that predispose to arrhythymia. (This effect appears to be smaller for
escitalopram, which does not carry a similar FDA warning and is a reasonable alternative
[12].) The merit of this warning, which did not take into account the evidence for benefit
from higher doses in OCD, has been questioned [13]. Nevertheless, its existence complicates
the clinical use of citalopram at high doses for OCD, and many clinicians have switched to
escitalopram or another SSRI as an alternative. Because all of the SSRIs have similar
efficacy, there is little reason not to make such a switch. In individual patients who have
clearly benefited from citalopram and do not wish to make a switch, ECG monitoring is
advisable.
Children and adolescents
The use of SSRIs in children and adolescents differs in some ways from their use in adults.
Although randomized, placebo-controlled trials clearly demonstrate benefits of SSRI in
children with OCD, concerns regarding side effects are more substantial [6]. The added
benefit from higher doses of SSRIs, which is clear in adults, has not been demonstrated in
the pediatric population. Three of the SSRIs are approved by the FDA for use in children:

fluoxetine (age 7 and above), sertraline (age 6 and above), and fluvoxamine (age 8 and
above). Clomipramine is also FDA-approved for children 10 and above.
Clomipramine
The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine was the first agent shown clearly to be beneficial
in patients with OCD [4]; it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of OCD in 1989. Of
the tricyclics, clomipramine is the most potent inhibitor of serotonin reuptake. It is
sometimes described as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) – not an SSRI, because it also
binds with high affinity to other receptors and reuptake sites. Meta-analysis suggests that
clomipramine may be more efficacious than the SSRIs [14]. However, a variety of technical
issues (such as drug dosing and the difficulty maintaining a blind in studies of clomipramine
due to its side effect profile) complicate this interpretation, and head-to-head trials
comparing clomipramine with SSRIs have not shown it to be superior [3]. The fact that
higher doses of SSRIs are more efficacious suggests that studies using standard SSRI doses
may underestimate the benefit of these agents and therefore bias a comparison with
clomipramine (for which dose elevation is not possible due to the risk of cardiac toxicity).
On the other hand, our recent meta-analysis suggests added benefit to clomipramine even
when SSRI dosage is appropriately taken into account [10]. It seems likely that
clomipramine has a small added benefit, at least for some patients.
This modestly greater efficacy must be balanced against clomipramine’s more problematic
side effect and safety profile. In contrast to SSRIs, clomipramine has significant
anticholinergic side effects (e.g. dry mouth and constipation), anti-histaminergic effects (e.g.
weight gain and sedation) and alpha-adrenergic blocking effects (e.g. hypotension). It also
has substantial arrhythmogenic potential; doses at or above the upper limit of the
recommended dosing range, 250 mg, may require ECG monitoring, and cardiotoxicity in
overdose is a concern. Clomipramine also carries a risk of seizure at doses above 250 mg.
For all of these reasons, clomipramine is not generally considered a first-line agent. It
remains an important alternative when SSRI monotherapy fails [3].
One pharmacological strategy that is sometimes used is the addition of clomipramine to an
SSRI, or of an SSRI to clomipramine. The motivating logic is that this may capture the
benefits of clomipramine without requiring doses that produce problematic side effects.
However, controlled data on the use of these strategies are sparse [15] and do not provide
clear guidance as to their efficacy. The combination of clomipramine with fluvoxamine can
be problematic and is best avoided. Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of the liver enzyme
CYP2C19 and thus inhibits the metabolism of clomipramine to desmethyl-clomipramine.
This can result in marked elevations of serum clomipramine when the two agents are coadministered, raising the risk of side effects such as seizure or arrhythmia [16].
Discontinuation of treatment
Only a few studies have addressed the issue of how long to continue pharmacotherapy, once
a clinical response has been achieved. This is of course a complex decision in individual
cases, with benefit being weighed in the context of side effects, patient attitudes,
comorbidities, the potential for drug interactions, pregnancy and lactation, and other factors.

OCD is often a chronic condition, and remission is unfortunately rare. Treatment of an
episode to remission followed by treatment discontinuation is, therefore, not a common
clinical scenario.
This question can be addressed using a double-blind discontinuation study design, in which
a group of stably treated patients are randomized to continue on their pharmacotherapy or be
switched to a placebo. One recent study found much higher relapse rate in patients switched
to placebo (52%) than those who continued on stable escitalopram (23%) [17]. A metaanalysis of similar studies supports this conclusion, with relapse rates in individuals
switched from stable active pharmacotherapy to placebo approximately double those in
patients maintained on their SSRI pharmacotherapy [18]. In general, once symptom
improvement on a stable medication regimen has been achieved, these results suggest that
continuation of treatment is advisable, in the absence of intolerable side effects or other
case-specific factors.
SNRIs
The efficacy of clomipramine led to the hypothesis that dual-acting serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake blockers might be of greater benefit than SSRIs [19]. Indeed, an
early open-label study of venlafaxine suggested that SNRIs are highly effective in the
treatment of SSRI-refractory OCD, with response rates of 76% in 29 subjects [20].
However, while other uncontrolled case series have continued to suggest benefit, a
subsequent double-blind crossover study suggested that venlafaxine may actually be less
effective than paroxetine in the treatment of refractory OCD [21]. When 43 patients who
failed to respond to one of these two agents were switched in a double-blind fashion to the
alternative agent, the response rate to paroxetine (56%) was significantly higher than that to
venlafaxine (19%) [21]. While there continues to be some theoretical rationale for the use of
SNRIs, they cannot be recommended for OCD monotherapy on the basis of currently
available data. Further research is needed.
Pharmacological augmentation
Monotherapy with agents beyond the SRIs has not been shown to be of benefit in OCD.
When SRI monotherapy fails, therefore, pharmacological augmentation with other agents is
a frequent recourse. Clear evidence exists for benefit from the addition of low-dose
neuroleptics to stable SRIs. Numerous other agents have been investigated in this context,
but the evidence for benefit is less clear. Nevertheless, because up to 30% of patients
experience little benefit from the best evidence-based treatments, clinicians must in practice
often turn to these less well-established strategies.
Neuroleptic augmentation
Double-blind trials in the late 1990s demonstrated efficacy of augmentation of SSRI
pharmacotherapy with low-dose typical and atypical antipsychotics in OCD. A recent metaanalysis of 9 double-blind, placebo controlled trials of augmentation with typical or atypical
antipsychotics demonstrated their efficacy compared to placebo [22, 23]. Approximately
one-third of treatment refractory OCD patients will respond to antipsychotic augmentation;
Pittenger and Bloch

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
the NNT is 4.6. OCD patients with comorbid tic disorders appear to respond particularly
well to antipsychotic augmentation. There is no evidence that any particular antipsychotic
commonly used as augmentation is any better than any other antipsychotic agent, although
the most convincing evidence for efficacy exists for haloperidol and risperidone. It should
be noted that not all studies show positive results; one recent study found no benefit from
the addition of risperidone to stable clomipramine treatment (whereas the addition of
cognitive behavioral therapy was highly beneficial) [24]. It is clear that not all patients
benefit from neuroleptic augmentation; the patients included in this recent study study had
fewer tics and may have been less treatment resistant than those in earlier studies, which
may explain the discrepant results.
In general, antipsychotic augementation should not be considered until two SRI trials of
adequate dose and duration have been attempted, because of the more benign side effect
profile of the SRIs and the reasonable likelihood of response to extended treatment or a
switch to a second agent. However, if significant symptoms persist after two such trials,
augmentation with a low dose of an antipsychotic represents a realistic treatment option,
espeically in patients with a personal or family history of tics.
Glutamatergic agents: the NMDA receptor
Substantial recent interest has focused on the role of glutamate imbalance in OCD [25].
Polymorphisms in the gene for the major neuronal glutamate transporter have been
associated with OCD, though the nature of any causative polymorphism remains unclear
[26]. Several magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have indicated abnormalities
in glutamate and related molecules, although again the specific nature of the hypothesized
disruption remains unclear [27]. Finally, a pair of studies examining cerebrospinal fluid in
unmedicated adults with OCD have found elevated glutamate levels [28, 29]. These findings
have spurred interest in the use of gluatmate modulators for pharmacological augmentation
in SRI-refractory disease; several such agents are already approved for other indications.
Because these findings suggest an excess of extrasynaptic glutamate, anti-glutamatergic
modulators have been the most extensively investgiated.
Agents targeting the NMDA class of glutamate receptor have received particular attention. It
has been targeted in several distinct ways, which may have different effects on neuronal
function and circuit dynamics. Memantine, which is used for the treatment of Alzheimer
disease, is a low-affinity noncompetitive NMDA blocker. A series of small uncontrolled
studies have suggested benefit in both adults and children with OCD [30–33]. One of these
suggested differential benefit in OCD compared to generalized anxiety disorder, indicating
that there may be some diagnostic specificity to the effect [31]. More recently, a pair of
blinded, placebo controlled studies from Iran examined memantine augmentation [34] or
monotherapy [35] and found a surprisingly substantial benefit. The effects reported are
substantially more robust than what is suggested by the previously reported open-label
studies, reaching 100% response and 89% remission after 8 weeks of treatment. These
studies are promising, but replication in other populations is needed to increase confidence
in the generalizability of the results. On the other hand, as memantine is an FDA-approved
medication with a rather benign side effect profile at the doses used (typically 20 mg/dy),

emprical use in refractory patients may be reasonable even in the absence of definitive
studies.
Several other studies have reported benefit from indirect modulators of the NMDA receptor.
Glycine is a co-agonist of the NMDA receptor and is required for its full activation. In a
small study, blinded treatment with glycine (or placebo) appeared to improve symptoms, an
effect that nearly reached significance in an analysis of completers [36]. Unfortunately,
glycine was very poorly tolerated, and there were many dropouts. Another small, open-label
study investigated the naturally occurring amino acide analog sarcosine, which is an
inhibitor of glycine reuptake and thus is predicted to indirectly increase synaptic glycine.
There was a 20% reduction in OCD symptoms; this must be interpreted with caution in the
absence of a placebo comparison group but is encouraging [37].
A third set of studies have used the high-potency anesthetic NMDA blocker ketamine. These
are motivated by the startling observation that a single challenge with ketamine can have
rapid antidepressant effects lasting days or 1–2 weeks, even in treatment-refractory MDD
[38]. Two fairly small studies of ketamine challege in OCD have yielded conflicting results.
In a placebo-controlled study of unmedicated patients, Rodriguez et al have shown a pattern
of response very similar to what has been reported in MDD: a rapid improvement within
hours of a ketamine infusion that lasts several days before symtoms return to baseline [39].
In contrast, in a somewhat more ill group of patients, many of whom had comorbidities and
many of whom were medicated, Bloch and colleagues found no clinically significant benefit
from ketamine [40]. This second study did not have a placebo control group, but many of
the subjects were depressed, and many of those exhibited an improvement in their
depressive symptoms, which therefore dissociated, from OCD subjects in the same subjects.
This provides an ‘internal control’ documenting the adequacy of the ketamine infusion. It
remains unclear whether the discrepancy between these two studies derives from
methodological factors or from differences in the patient populations studied. Further
research is needed. Regardless, ketamine is unlikely to become a major part of the
pharmacological armamentarium: as currently administered it requires IV infusion; the
effects are transient; and both basic and clinical literature raise concerns about the
neurotoxic potential of chronic ketamine exposure. As in depression, therefore, any benefit
from ketamine challenge is likely to be more useful as a guide to the development of future
therapeutics than as a new treatment option in its own right.
It is important to note that these three ways of modulating the NMDA receptor are
fundamentally different from one another. Memantine chronically blocks NMDA receptor
function; in both open-label and controlled studies, benefit has been seen after weeks.
Glycine and sarcosine, in contrast, are positive modulators of NMDA function and may
potentiate it. Finally, ketamine is a much more potent antagonist than memantine, but its use
in studies to date is fundamentally different, consisting of an acute challenge rather than
chronic treatment for weeks. These very different ways of targeting the receptor are likley to
have fundamentally different effects on neuronal and circuit functioning. If ongoing research
corroborates the benefit of more than one of these interventiaol stratgies, an explanation for
this fact will be called for.

Other glutamate-modulating agents
A variety of other glutamate-modulating agents have been tried in OCD, chiefly in small,
uncontrolled studies. A pair of open-label studies in profoundly refractory patients suggests
benefit from the glutamate modulator riluzole, which is approved by the FDA for the
treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [41, 42]; however, controlled data have not yet
been reported. Riluzole is generally well tolerated, and some patients have been on it
continuously for years without problems [42]. Riluzole has several mechanisms of action; it
remains unclear which may provide benefit in OCD [43].
The antiepileptic topiramate is thought to modulate neuronal glutamate levels through its
interaction with voltage-gated ion channels. Two controlled trials have suggested benefit
from topiramate, at a variety of doses; there is some evidence of a greater effect on
compulsions than on obsessions [44, 45]. Cognitive, sedative, and weight-loss side effects
may limit the use of topiramate in some cases.
Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic and mood stabilizer. It is thought to reduce neuronal
glutamate outflow through its inhibition of certain voltage-gated sodium channels, a
mechanism that overlaps with some of the effects of riluzole [43]. An initial investigation of
lamotrigine in OCD provided no evidence of benefit [46]. However, a more recent
randomized trial investigated lamotrigine augmentation of stable SSRI treatment and found
marked benefit, with 50% responders in the lamotrigine group and none in the placebo
group [47]. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, and more work is needed.
The amino acid derivative N-acetylcysteine has both antioxidant and glutamate-modulating
properties. It has been examined in a variety of conditions and is an attractive agent because
it is availaele over-the-counter, is extremely affordable, and has few side effects. An early
case report suggested benefit in OCD [48]. More recently a placebo-controlled trial from
Iran suggested marked benefit of the addition of N-acetycysteine to stable SSRI treatment in
adults with OCD [49]. More work is needed; but the many attractive characteristics of this
agent may make it a viable option in some cases once better-proven strategies have been
exhausted.
Other pharmacological augmentation strategies
A variety of other agents have been used to augment ineffective SSRI treatment; none are
sufficiently well supported by the literature to have entered the standard of care, but small
studies provide intriguing evidence of benefit in several cases.
Mirtazapine is an α-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist and thus enhances norepinephrine
release [50]; it also indirectly enhances serotonergic neurotransmission. A case series of 6
OCD patients suggested that mirtazapine is ineffective as an augmentation agent for
treatment-refractory OCD [20]. However, in an unblinded trial of 49 treatment-naïve OCD
patients, subjects receiving citalopram plus mirtazapine had an accelerated clinical response,
with a significantly greater reduction in OCD severity at 4 weeks compared to citalopramplus-placebo. Treatment response in the two groups equalized by 12 weeks [51]. This result
suggests that mirtazapine may be helpful in accelerating the initial response to SRI

pharmacotherapy but not increasing the ultimate likelihood of response in those who fail
initial SRI pharmacotherapy.
Opioid augmentation
The endogenous opioid system has been postulated to be involved in OCD pathogenesis
ever since it was noted that administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone exacerbated
OCD symptoms [52]. A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 23 treatment
refractory OCD patients demonstrated a significantly greater decreased in OCD symptoms
in response to weekly oral morphine compared to placebo [53]. Two weeks of oral morphine
produced a median decrease in Y-BOCS severity of 13%, with 7 of the 23 subjects (30%)
being treatment responders [53]. Tramadol hydrochloride, an opioid agonist with lower
abuse potential than morphine, has been studied as an augmentation agent for treatment
refractory OCD in an open-label trial. The six treatment-refractory OCD patients included in
this study experienced an average decline of Y-BOCS scores of 26% [54]. Further doubleblind studies are needed to establish the efficacy of tramadol as an augmentation agent in
OCD.
Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor agonist that is used as an anti-emetic. Several small
studies have suggested benefit from low doses of ondansetron and of the related agent
granisetron in OCD [55, 56]. The studies showing the clearest effects are again from Iran
[57, 58]. In December of 2012, Transcept Pharmaceuticals announced that a Phase 2 trial of
ondansetron had not met its primary efficacy endpoint [59]. The role, if any, for 5-HT3
agonists as augmentation in refractory disease remains to be clarified.
Caffeine was included as an active control in a pilot study of amphetamine augmentation in
OCD. Both dextroamphetamine and caffeine led to significant improvements in refractory
patients over 5 weeks [60]. The potential clinical use of these stimulants has not yet been
followed up in larger studies.
In sum, small studies of varying quality have led to several intriguing possibilities for
augmentation strategies in OCD that is refractory to standard pharmacological approaches.
However, in none of these cases is such an approach supported by multiple high-quality
studies. Further research is needed to address the unmet clinical needs of the substantial
minority of OCD patients who do not respond to standard-of-care treatment.
Over-the-counter agents
There has been significant interest in a variety of over-the-counter (OTC) agents for OCD
[61, 62]. These are often perceived as safer and more ‘natural’ than prescription
pharmacotherapy, which makes them attractive to many patients. N-acetylcysteine,
sarcosine, and glycine, which have been addressed above in the context of glutamate
modulators, fall into this category. Unfortunately, variable quality control makes it difficult
to use these less-regulated agents with confidence, and the research base guiding their use
remains very thin. We have recently reviewed this literature and provide guidance for the
use of OTC agents [63]. We will not extensively review the literature on these agents here
but rather highlight those for which there is some substantive evidence of benefit. Most OTC

agents are well tolerated, which is why they are lightly regulated; the typically low risk
associated with their moderate use may make such a strategy reasonable, when preferred by
individual patients, even when the evidence for benefit is less than robust.
Myo-inositol has been examined in two small studies. The first found evidence of benefit
from monotherapy [64]. A follow-up study from the same group found no benefit from the
addition of myo-inositol to stable SSRI treatment [65]. The authors suggest that this
indicates an interaction, such that myo-inositol is only efficacious when used as monotherapy. However, both of these studies, while well designed, were small. More work would
be needed to substantiate the use of myo-inositol to the point that it could be recommended
as part of the standard of care.
Other agents
Small studies have investigated a number of other agents, including kava, St. John’s wort,
borage, milk thistle, eicosapentaenoic acid, and tryptophan [63]. However, for none of these
is there substantial evidence of benefit for OCD symptoms (though St. John’s wort may be
of benefit for comorbid depressive symptoms). Potential side effects are of concern in some
cases, especially with chronic use of kava.
Combination treatment
SSRI pharmacotherapy and behavioral and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy are
considered first-line treatments for OCD. (Psychotherapies for OCD are reviewed elsewhere
in this issue.) It is intuitive that their combination would be more efficacious than either
alone. Surprisingly, careful studies suggest that this may not always be the case, at least in
an idealized setting in adults.
In the pediatric population, the POTS trial (Pediatric OCD Treatment Study) compared
CBT, sertraline, and their combination with placebo in 112 children with OCD [66]. All
active treatments were superior to placebo and were well tolerated. Combination treatment
was more effective than either CBT alone or sertraline alone, supporting synergistic benefit.
A follow-up study found that the addition of CBT to stable pharmacotherapy can provide
further improvement [67]. This pair of large, definitive studies establishes rather clearly that
the combination of medication and psychotherapy is more effective than either one alone, in
the pediatric population.
In adults, the benefits of combination therapy are less clear. A large study comparing expert
CBT, clomipramine, and their combination to placebo found that the benefit of CBT
exceeded that of clomipramine, and that combination treatment provided no significant
additional improvement [68]. A follow-up study from the same group looked at the addition
of CBT to stable SRI treatment, compared to risperidone augmentation. CBT was markedly
superior [24]. These studies suggest that combination treatment may not provide benefit.
However, important caveats to this conclusion must be noted. The CBT provided in these
studies was intensive (twice weekly) and was administered by particularly skilled experts at
academic centers; it is likely to be more potent than CBT as practiced in the community,
Pittenger and Bloch

even by experienced practitioners. Medication in these studies was administered in a
manualized, relatively inflexible way, which may not recapitulate typical pharmacological
strategies. In clinical practice, most authorities continue to recommend combination therapy
as having potential benefits above and beyond medication or therapy alone [3]. For example,
some patients cannot tolerate the anxiety that is inherent to CBT until their symptoms are
somewhat moderated by medication.
Augmentation of psychotherapy through enhancement of plasticity
As our understanding of the brain processes underlying learning advances, an exciting
prospect is that this knowledge can be harnessed to enhance the potency and specificity of
psychotherapy. While such synergistic strategies have not entered mainstream clinical
practice, there are several promising initial steps in this direction, especially in the treatment
of anxiety disorders.
The NMDA glutamate receptor, described above, has a key role in modulating the strength
of connections between neurons, which is thought to be a key substrate for learning. In
animals, enhancement of NMDA receptor function can enhance learning [69]. This
observation has led to the idea that transient enhancement of NMDA function, in
conjunction with focused psychotherapeutic interventions, might lead to improved efficacy
[70]. An initial proof of concept of this approach was provided by Ressler, Davis, and
colleagues in a seminal set of studies. In animals, they showed that D-cycloserine, a positive
allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, enhanced extinction of learned fear in animals
[71]. They then applied this strategy to the extinction-based treatment of acrophobia, and
found that D-cycloserine enhanced clinical response [72].
Several studies have sought to apply this approach to the treatment of OCD. Results to date
are mixed, with some studies showing enhanced efficacy or rate of responding in patients
treated with D-cycloserine prior to CBT sessions [73]. Variables such as the dosage and the
timing of D-cycloserine administration are likely to be key to any benefit. The effect of Dcycloserine appears to decrease over CBT sessions, which may indicate that the primary
effect is on the rate of responding, rather than on the ultimate efficacy of the treatment [73].
D-cycloserine is reasonably well tolerated and is available at compounding pharmacies; this
strategy is therefore available to clinicians, though it has not entered widespread use. These
findings are perhaps more valuable as a demonstration of the viability of plasticityenhancing manipulations to optimize the response to CBT; further research in this area may
lead to more dramatic interactive effects.
It is important to note that the targeting of the NMDA receptor using D-cycloserine is
qualitatively different from the pharmacological use of memantine, ketamine, or glycine,
which have been discussed above. When D-cycloserine is used in conjunction with CBT,
function of the NMDA receptor is acutely enhanced, in order to potentiate plasticity.
Glycine, and similar agents, seek to chronically enhance NMDA receptor function. In
contrast, ketamine transiently blocks the NMDA receptor, while memantine treatment has
been used to chronically block it. The fact that such disparate therapeutic strategies targeting
a single target, with some evidence of benefit for each, speaks to the centrality of this
receptor in brain function and in psychopathology.

Pharmacogenetics
There has been great excitement in recent years about pharmacogenetics: the possibility of
using individual genetic data to predict drug response and/or side effects, and thus to
meaningfully guide treatment choices. The appeal and theoretical potential of this approach
cannot be denied. As the response to medication treatment in OCD is highly heterogeneous
and the disorder has a substantial genetic component, this may be a particularly appropriate
context for a pharmacogenetic approach.
In MDD, significant work has been done in this area and has implicated polymorphisms in a
number of genes as predictors of antidepressant response [74, 75]. In contrast, progress in
establishing genetic polymorphisms with predictive value in OCD has been relatively slow
[76]. Over the past decade, our ability to gather genetic information has rapidly outstripped
our knowledge of which polymorphisms are prognostically useful. Because a number of
companies are now offering genotyping services to patients, it is increasingly critical for
clinicians to be in a position to interpret such data.
Conceptually, there are two ways in which genetic polymorphisms may contribute to
medication response. First, they could affect pharmacokinetics, by altering drug metabolism
or transport; well-characterized polymorphisms in the liver’s cytochrome P450 system or the
blood brain barrier efflux pump are likely to fall into this category. Alternatively,
polymorphisms in brain-expressed molecules related to hypothesized pathophysiological
mechanisms are more likely to alter a drug’s pharmacodynamics actions, either by directly
altering its interactions with its molecular targets or by changing the way interacting
molecules or cellular processes react to drug effects. Polymorphisms in components of the
serotonergic and glutamatergic system are more likely to fall into this latter category,
although it may not be possible (or necessary) to make this distinction with confidence a
priori.
Examination of loci in pharmacogenetic studies can be done either in a targeted, hypothesisdriven fashion, by picking genes of potential interest with known polymorphisms and
examining them in the target population, or in an exploratory fashion, in which the genome
is queried more broadly to find loci associated with response (i.e. pharmacogenomics). The
latter approach requires many more subjects and has not yet been used in OCD.
The cytochrome P450 enzymes are highly polymorphic in the population and have a wellcharacterized role in drug metabolism, including in the metabolism in a number of drugs
commonly used for the treatment of OCD. Given that polymorphisms in this system are well
established to affect the rate at which different individuals metabolize specific drugs, and
thus the concentration of active drug to enter the brain and the concentration of potentially
active metabolites, this system represents a promising target for pharmacogenetic studies. A
recent investigation examined P450 polymorphisms in 184 patients with OCD [77]. The
strongest effect was an association of low-activity variants in the gene CYP2D6 with the
number of past failed treatment trials in these patients, which may be a surrogate marker for
refractoriness. There was also a lower incidence of side effects from venlafaxine in
individuals with normal (‘extensive’) CYP2D6 metabolic activity than those with lower
Pittenger and Bloch

metabolizing alleles. This may be due to the fact that venlafaxine is metabolized to an active
metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, which is therefore reduced in low-metabolizers. Trendlevel effects suggested an influence of CYP2D6 metabolizer status on response to fluoxetine
and of CYP2C19 status on response to sertraline. These findings require replication and do
not yet provide clear guidance for the application of genetic data to treatment selection, but
they represent a promising start to a potentially important new source of information to
guide clinical decision-making.
Other small studies in OCD have examined polymorphisms in genes more likely to be
associated with pharmacodynamics, such as the serotonin receptor HTR2A, the serotonin
transporter SLC6A4, the neurotransmitter BDNF, and the monoamine metabolic enzyme
COMT. However, these studies have by and large been small and inconsistent [76]. More
work is needed in this area.
Conclusion
Our treatments for OCD remain inadequate. While a majority of patients will respond to
established pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapeutic approaches, approximately a quarter
do not. Furthermore, many of those who are classified as ‘responders’ continue to have
substantial symptoms and a chronic reduction in productivity and in quality of life.
The SSRIs are the mainstay of the pharmacological treatment of OCD. Their combination of
efficacy with relatively good tolerability is not matched by any other available agents. There
is no known difference in the efficacy of different SSRIs, and thus the choice of agent is best
guided by side effects, pharmacokinetic considerations, and patient preference. Higher doses
and longer duration of treatment, relative to standard practice in the treatment of MDD, is
often required. Clomipramine provides an alternative for monotherapy and may be
marginally more effective, but its side effect profile mitigates against its use as a first-line
agent in most cases. When monotherapy fails, augmentation with low-dose neuroleptic
(especially risperidone) or psychotherapy has good support in the literature. Other
augmentation strategies are less well established but are often appropriate when first- and
second-line approaches have been exhausted.
Perhaps the most important conclusion from this review of pharmacotherapeutic options is
that there is a relative paucity of well-established treatment options in OCD, when SSRI
treatment fails. This contrasts with MDD, schizophrenia, and many other major psychiatric
conditions, in which numerous mechanistically distinct pharmacological strategies are
available and algorithms for stepped treatment are being developed. It is to be hoped that, as
more research is done in the pathophysiology and treatment of OCD and related disorders,
clinicians will have a broader array of treatment options in the future.

Secondary infections arise as a consequence of previous or concurrent conditions
and occur in the community or in the hospital setting. The events allowing secondary
infections to gain a foothold have been studied for many years and include poor
nutrition, anxiety, mental health issues, underlying chronic diseases, resolution of acute
inﬂammation, primary immune deﬁciencies, and immune suppression by infection or
medication. Children, the elderly and the ill are particularly susceptible. This review
is concerned with secondary bacterial infections of the lung that occur following viral
infection. Using inﬂuenza virus infection as an example, with comparisons to rhinovirus
and respiratory syncytial virus infection, we will update and review defective bacterial
innate immunity and also highlight areas for potential new investigation. It is currently
estimated that one in 16 National Health Service (NHS) hospital patients develop an
infection, the most common being pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections, urinary
tract infections and infection of surgical sites. The continued drive to understand the
mechanisms of why secondary infections arise is therefore of key importance.

INTRODUCTION
It has been appreciated for a long time that infections following surgical cases are caused by a breach
of skin barrier integrity. This breach of barrier tissue (e.g. the skin or epithelial surfaces lining
the lung, gastro-intestinal or urogenital tract) however, is common during non-surgical infection
and was one of the ﬁrst causes identiﬁed to enhance bacterial outgrowth in the lung, by providing
diﬀerent substrates for adhesion and access to additional proteins for bacteria to metabolize. In this
review we will discuss the changes in immunity that lead to dysregulation of responses and how
prior viral infection in the lung suppresses cellular innate immunity facilitating bacterial outgrowth
to occur. Though we assume that cellular innate immunity is adequate before viral infection, it is
important to consider that patients most at risk of developing secondary bacterial complications
may have a complex inﬂammatory history, medications, co-morbidities or mental-health history
that has already inﬂuenced innate immunity. We will not cover the more soluble innate elements
such as anti-microbial peptides or surfactant proteins, as these have been covered extensively
elsewhere (1).
Morgan et al.
Innate Immune Training in Secondary Infections
Innate Immunity in the Healthy Lung
Innate immunity in the lung is important since it can facilitate
the elimination of many pathogens in the absence of adaptive
immunity and without immunopathological side eﬀects. The
actual location of some innate immune cell subsets is unclear due
to the changing environment within the branching structure of
the lung. A general rule however is that the density of immune
cells gets lower the further down the respiratory tract you look,
which facilitates optimal gaseous exchange.
As will be described for macrophages later, the immune
components present in a healthy lung are specialized and sparse.
Innate lymphoid cells exist in the naïve mouse lung at a low
frequency of 0.4–1%. Their precise lung location in health
however, has not been determined (2, 3), though they do expand
during lung inﬂammation [for a review see (4)]. Gamma delta
(γδ) T cells are also present and rare, accounting for ∼1–5%
of blood (5) and 8–10% of lung lymphocytes. They display a
restricted proﬁle of variable genes (Vγ4, Vδ1, and Vδ6) (6)
in their T cell receptor, which changes with age to become
predominantly Vγ4+ (7, 8). NK cells constitute 10% of resident
lymphocytes in the lung (9) and it is thought their survival
depends on IL-15 production by bronchial epithelial cells (10).
NK cells detect an absence of MHC class I molecules using a
variety of cell surface receptors and are induced to kill target cells
by an activating receptor that binds stress ligands (11). In this
way, NK cells present in the interstitial compartment are poised
to recognize abnormality.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are present in the lung interstitial
spaces (12) and the pulmonary epithelium (13), but are absent
from the airspaces. In mice, DCs in the epithelium (CD103+
CD11blo) require Batf3, IRF8, and Flt3 ligand for development,
whereas those in the lung parenchyma require M-CSF (14).
Either population may derive from bone marrow or a local
precursor cell population (15). In the steady state, the DCs
present in the epithelium may be important for sampling luminal
content and/or clearing apoptotic cell turnover (16). As with
other innate immune cells, the density of dendritic cells will
depend on the position in the respiratory tree with more being
present in bronchi than alveoli. Dendritic cells and follicular
dendritic cells are also located in sparse B cell follicles. Though
typically absent in naïve mice and humans, aggregates of B and
T cells may be located next to the major bronchi and include
follicular dendritic, dendritic, and stromal, cells (17).
Macrophage Subsets in the Lung
Generally, an absence in any of the innate immune cells
described above has little aﬀect in healthy lungs. However,
lung macrophages have a unique role in health by performing
general housekeeping duties, as exempliﬁed by the build-up of
proteinaceous material due to an absence of macrophages in mice
lacking granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) (18). In rodents and humans, the lungs are home to two
distinct macrophage subsets: airway macrophages and interstitial
macrophages (19). We refer to airway, rather than alveolar
macrophages since bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples
the whole airway. This procedure typically elutes 90–95%
macrophages in health, the majority of which will be derived from
the alveoli, in addition to a small number of lymphocytes (20,
21). Alveolar macrophages are remarkably long-lived and selfrenewing and therefore do not require continuous replenishment
from bone marrow-derived precursors in health (22–24). In
contrast, interstitial macrophages have a higher turnover rate and
are shorter lived in the steady state (25). Interstitial macrophages
are located in the interstitial space between the alveoli and
capillaries and are less abundant than alveolar macrophages (26).
Alveolar
macrophages
are
initially
derived
from
fetal
monocytes and their development is reliant on GM-CSF,
of which there is an abundance of in the airspaces shortly
after birth (27, 28). GM-CSF drives production of alveolar
macrophages through induction of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-γ (PPARγ) expression (27, 29, 30). Mice
lacking GM-CSF (or its receptor), and patients with defects in
GM-CSF signaling, develop pulmonary alveolar proteinosis due
to a build-up of surfactant in the airways because of a lack of
clearance by macrophages (31, 32). Following irradiation (27) or
inﬂuenza infection (22) airway macrophages become depleted
and are replenished from the periphery or the interstitial lung
macrophage pool, respectively. On the other hand, interstitial
macrophages originate from bone marrow derived-monocytes
and are preferentially replenished by this population during
inﬂammation (33). A recent study has identiﬁed 3 populations of
interstitial macrophages based on phenotypic and transcriptomic
studies, which are diﬀerent to airway macrophages (34).
The Function of Airway Macrophages
The mechanisms leading to bacterial outgrowth following lung
viral infection are, to a large extent, driven by the attempt to
return the lung to health. Understanding the role of innate
immune cells in lung health therefore, may provide clues to why
complications can occur. Due to their location, macrophages
in the airways display phenotypic and functional diﬀerences to
other macrophage populations. Alveolar macrophages reside in
the alveolar lumen and are surrounded by surfactant, which
contains proteins that dampen macrophage activity (35). This
allows alveolar macrophages to be tolerant to cellular debris and
innocuous antigens, thereby preventing excessive tissue damage,
while setting an activation threshold that needs to be overcome
to eﬃciently clear more pathogenic microorganisms (21). On
the other hand, interstitial macrophages are in close contact
with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and, as such, have a more
prominent role in modulating tissue ﬁbrosis, as well as being
better equipped for antigen presentation (36, 37). Moreover,
alveolar macrophages have reduced phagocytic activity and
respiratory burst in comparison to interstitial macrophages (38,
39). Both subsets of macrophages inhibit T cell activation and
subsequent onset of adaptive immunity via the suppression of
DC activation; a process dependent on the anti-inﬂammatory
cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-β
(TGFβ) and prostaglandins (40, 41). Alveolar macrophages are
poor at presenting antigen to T cells (42), although they are
capable of transporting antigens to the lung-draining lymph
nodes (43). Likewise, human alveolar macrophages induce
T cell antigen-speciﬁc unresponsiveness as a result of poor
antigen presentation and a lack of expression of co-stimulatory

it is important to appreciate the role of the epithelium in
regulating airway macrophage activity. Due to their direct
exposure to environmental challenges in the alveolar lumen,
strategies need to be in place for alveolar macrophages to discern
a harmless antigen from a serious pathogenic threat. For this
reason, alveolar macrophages are tightly regulated in order to
prevent an inﬂammatory response against cellular debris and
innocuous antigens, whilst still providing protection against
harmful pathogens by propelling an inﬂammatory response (35).
For example, alveolar macrophages are hypo-responsive to low
levels of endotoxins, which are present in ambient air (21),
thereby preventing an inappropriate innate immune response
to innocuous antigens. A number of mechanisms are in place
to suppress the activity of alveolar macrophages, including their
interaction with the airway epithelium. The airway epithelium,
through both direct contact and secreted products, negatively
regulates alveolar macrophage activity. These factors include
CD200, TGF-β, IL-10 and surfactant proteins (SP-A and SPD), which act to suppress macrophage phagocytic ability and
production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (45–47) (Figure 1).
Though beneﬁcial in some instances, these pathways can slow
immediate immune activity. For example, knockout of IL-10
is beneﬁcial as it allows immediate protection against acute
inﬂuenza with better survival at lethal infection levels (48,
49). However, inhibiting IL-10 after acute inﬂuenza infection
results in tissue inﬂammation and damage, with decreased
survival (49, 50), similar to IL-10 knockout S.pneumoniae
bacterial models (51). For an in-depth discussion on this
see (48–51).
In addition, these mechanisms set a threshold of activation
that needs to be overcome in order for an inﬂammatory response
to be triggered. Activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling,
through recognition of an invading pathogen, elicits a strong
enough immune response to exceed the inhibitory regulation
of alveolar macrophages and causes up-regulation of TLR coreceptors including CD14 and triggering receptor expressed on
myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) (52). Furthermore, loss of epithelial
integrity during inﬂammation reduces the level of regulatory
factors, releasing alveolar macrophages from epithelial-induced
inhibition. This increases their phagocytic capabilities and
initiates the production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (37, 53).
The inhibitory factors that are important in maintaining airway
homeostasis are also crucial in resolving inﬂammation after
elimination of the microbial pathogen. Both CD200 and TGF-β
assist in the suppression of inﬂammation, promote resolution
and restore homeostasis (47).
Dominant Viral Infections in the Lung
Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), human rhinovirus
(hRV),
human
parainﬂuenza
virus
(hPIV)
and
human
metapneumovirus (hMPV), are the major types of viruses
FIGURE 1 | Inhibitory regulation of alveolar macrophages by the airway
epithelium. Strict regulation of macrophage activation is required for
homeostatic control of the general lung environment. As alveolar macrophages
are under constant exposure to airborne endotoxins hypo-responsiveness is
required for normal airway macrophage function. This is contributed through a
number of downstream pathways triggered by airway epithelial cells
production of IL-10, TGFβ, CD200, and surfactant proteins (SPA and SPD)
and these reduce pro-inﬂammatory signaling and phagocytosis in airway
macrophages via their respective cell surface receptors. The cascade of
downstream inhibitory pathways to suppress macrophage activation are

responsible for acute infections of the upper and lower
respiratory tract (54). These respiratory viruses represent a
signiﬁcant burden on global public health, with acute respiratory
tract infections (ARTIs) being the fourth highest cause of global
mortality (55).
Inﬂuenza virus is a member of the orthomyxovirus family
and a negative sense, single stranded RNA virus (56). The viral
envelope of inﬂuenza virus is composed of haemagglutinin (HA)
and neuraminidase (NA) (57), which are used as identiﬁers of
virus subtypes (58, 59). There are four genera of inﬂuenza virus;
A, B, C, and D, with the inﬂuenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2
causing the largest proportion of inﬂuenza cases (60). Inﬂuenza
virus infection is one of the leading causes of respiratory tract
infections worldwide, with ∼5–20% of the global population
infected and a mortality rate of up to 650,000 patients annually1
(61). The inﬂuenza virus predominantly invades human upper
airway epithelial cells by binding to α-2,6 or α-2,3-linked sialy
glycans expressed on their surface (62–64). The inﬂuenza virus
can eﬀectively evade detection by the host immune system.
Genetic changes due to the error-prone nature of the viral
RNA polymerase, that result in antigenic drift or recombination
events between inﬂuenza viruses, can give rise to new subtypes
of inﬂuenza that can lead to epidemic or pandemic outbreaks
(65–67). Currently, our best options to combat inﬂuenza are
by prevention using vaccines and treatment with antiviral
medications. However, the variable nature of the virus limits the

eﬃcacy of both approaches as they need to be updated annually
to keep up with the evolution of new subtypes (68).
hRSV is the main cause of acute lower respiratory tract
infection (ALTRI) in infants, young children and older adults
(aged ≥65 years) (69). hRSV is an enveloped negative-sense
single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Pneumoviridae
family, Orthopneumovirus genus (69, 70). There are 2 major
antigenic groups of hRSV, A and B, which can be further
subdivided into 10 A genotypes and 13 B genotypes (71). The
highly contagious nature of the virus means nearly all children
will have been infected with hRSV by the age of 2 years old
(72). Bronchiolitis or pneumonia caused by hRSV infection is
the major cause of hospitalisations in children under the age of
2 years old. Additionally, hRSV infection has been implicated in
the development of childhood asthma and recurrent wheezing
(72–75). The global public health burden of hRSV is signiﬁcant,
with ∼10% of all hospital admissions for severe bronchiolitis
or pneumonia due to the virus, representing an annual cost of
about 394 million USD (76–78). The severity of hRSV infection
and associated clinical symptoms can be controlled by the use of
palivizumab, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to the fusion
glycoprotein (F protein), which is a transmembrane surface
protein in the viral envelope of hRSV (79–82). However, an
eﬀective vaccine against hRSV has yet to be developed.
The
development
of

and
recurrent
wheezing is not only closely linked with infant hRSV-induced
bronchiolitis, but is also associated with wheezing illnesses
due to hRV infection in infancy (83–86). A member of the
Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus, hRV is a non-enveloped
positive single-stranded virus (87, 88). hRVs can be classiﬁed
into three species, with RV-A and RV-C, causing more severe
respiratory illness, when compared to RV-B (88, 89). The species
can be further categorized into genotypes, of which there are over
100 (87, 90). hRVs circulate throughout the year, are transmitted
through direct contact or aerosol particles and are capable of
infecting both the lower and upper respiratory tracts (87, 91,
92). Symptoms following infection are generally that of the
common cold, including sore throat, cough, nasal congestion,
sneezing and rhinorrhoea. However, in infants, the elderly,
immunocompromised adults or those suﬀering from chronic
respiratory illnesses, infection with hRV can be more severe. For
example, hRV is responsible for 20–40% of all hospitalisations
due to wheezing in infants aged 12 months or less (93, 94).
Development of a vaccine and antivirals against hRV has been
hindered by the vast quantity of genetically distinct genotypes
(90, 95).
hPIV is second most common cause of ALTRI in children,
after hRSV (96). hPIV, like hRSV, is an enveloped negativesense single-stranded RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family
(97–99). hPIV consists of four major serotypes—hPIV-1 and
hPIV-3, genus Respirovirus and hPIV-2 and hPIV-4, genus
Rubulavirus (100). By the age of 2 years old 60% of children
have been infected by hPIV-3 and at the age of 5 years the
majority have been infected by hPIV-1, hPIV-2 and hPIV-3
(97, 101). Although hPIV has been predominantly viewed
as a cause of respiratory illness in pediatric patients, both
immunocompromised and older adults are also susceptible to
infection (97, 100). Clinical manifestations of infection by hPIV
include the common cold, croup (laryngotracheobronchitis),
tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia (100). However,
as of yet there is no eﬀective antiviral treatment or vaccine
available for hPIV.
Since its discovery in 2001, hMPV has been identiﬁed as one
of the major causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infection
in children, immunocompromised patients and the elderly, being
detected in 4–16% of patients with ARTIs (102–108). hMPV,
a negative-sense single stranded RNA virus, is a member of
the Paramyxoviridae family, genus Metapneumovirus, and is
closely related to hRSV and parainﬂuenza (108). Most infections
with hMPV elicit mild to moderate clinical symptoms, although
5–10% of cases result in admission to pediatric intensive care
(102, 107, 109).
Bacterial Outgrowths in the Lung
Following Viral Infection
A signiﬁcant contributor to morbidity and mortality in
respiratory viral infections is bacterial invasion. Given the
colonization of the upper respiratory tract with common
pathogens including Streptococcus (S) pneumoniae, Haemophilus
(H) inﬂuenzae and most of the Staphylococcus species, a
shift in immunological balance and the airway environment
can undoubtedly cause severe secondary bacterial infection in
the host. The most famous reports of bacterial colonization
after lung viral infection stem from the 1918 inﬂuenza
pandemic where between 20 and 60 million deaths were
due to bacterial co-infection (110). It is estimated that
∼25% of all inﬂuenza-related deaths are associated with coinfections, particularly during seasonal outbreaks (111, 112).
Viral respiratory infections elevate nasopharyngeal bacterial
density (113, 114), which may promote their colonization
in the lower airways, though the precise mechanisms are
unclear.
Bacterial co-infection is not limited to inﬂuenza virus. A
retrospective cohort study of 6,000 hospitalized neonates in
China showed that 94% had RSV infection, with the remainder
having parainﬂuenza, inﬂuenza virus or adenovirus. The
dominant co-infections in RSV infected neonates were E. coli,
Klebsiella (K) pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae
(115). The high frequency of RSV and pneumococci co-infection
in hospitalized children is reduced by prior pneumococcal
conjugate vaccination and has led to the suggestion that
treatment for secondary bacterial infections should be considered
for pneumonia cases even if a child tests positive for RSV (116).
The choice of antibacterial strategy may be critical since RSV
can increase S. pneumoniae virulence by binding to penicillin
binding protein 1a (117) and so penicillin derivatives may
be ineﬀective. Experimental studies on human Rhinovirus 16
infection enhances H. parainﬂuenzae, Neisseria subﬂava, and to
a lesser extent S. aureus in throat swabs (118). One study in
adults revealed that rhinovirus was the most common (23.6%),
then parainﬂuenza virus (20.8%), hMPV (18.1%), inﬂuenza
(16.7%), and RSV (13.9%). However, virus strain occurrence
may also be inﬂuenced by co-infections as RSV was signiﬁcantly

more common in those that also had community-associated
pneumonia (119).
Bacterial and viral infections co-exist, and the post-viral
bacterial outgrowths are often co-infections made up of diﬀerent
species of bacteria. In a recent meta-analysis, 28–35% of
patients demonstrated positive laboratory culture with the coinfective species, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, respectively
(120). S. pneumoniae is the most common pathogen that causes
community-acquired pneumonia and potential overwhelming
sepsis, and is associated with high mortality and morbidity
during inﬂuenza epidemics and pandemics (121, 122).
S. aureus, a gram-positive cocci and a common commensal
in the nose and skin, is a major cause of bacteraemia (123).
It is unclear why S. aureus has become a major cause of
concern particularly in the pediatric population, of which
a study of the 2003–4 season in the USA found that this
organism not only dominated inﬂuenza-associated childhood
mortalities, but was also found to be the most common causative
bacterial agent in 46% of isolates, whereby more than 50%
were methicillin-resistant strains (111). A rare and severe
complication of community-acquired pneumonia is necrotising
pneumonia,
characterized
by
pulmonary
consolidation,
inﬂammation, necrosis, and ultimately gangrene, which is caused
by methicillin-resistant S. aureus, a major public health concern
due to its resistance to antimicrobials. Prior or co-infection
with inﬂuenza infection and the presence of Panton-Valentine
leukocidin (PVL) are both signiﬁcantly associated with the
necrotising pneumonia (124).
Mechanisms of Bacterial Susceptibility
After Lung Viral Infection
Other than a breach of the epithelial barrier, there are a number
of modiﬁcations to cellular innate immunity in the lung that
contribute to secondary bacterial infection.
The Role of Apoptotic Cell Clearance Following Viral
Infection in Susceptibility to Secondary Bacterial
Infections
Cellular
turnover

and
inﬂammation. Airway macrophages play an important function
in clearing apoptotic cells, a process known as eﬀerocytosis,
which is essential in maintaining airway homeostasis (125).
Ineﬃcient clearance of apoptotic cells leads to secondary
necrosis and the release of damage associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) that subsequently promote an inﬂammatory response
(126). Eﬀerocytosis is mediated by a plethora of receptors that
recognize externalized proteins on the cell surface of apoptotic
cells. One of the most commonly studied proteins mediating
eﬀerocytosis is phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). PtdSer is present on
the inner plasma membrane in living cells, but is externalized
upon induction of apoptosis (127) by caspase inactivation of
ﬂippase (ATP11C) that is required to “ﬂip” PtdSer back into the
plasma membrane (128). Caspases also activate scramblases that
“scramble” phospholipids in the plasma membrane; promoting
exposure of PtdSer on apoptotic cells (129). Other proteins
that ﬂag up the presence of an apoptotic cell include oxidized
low-density lipoprotein, calreticulin, annexin A1, ICAM-3,
C1q, and thrombospondin (130). In parallel there are a number
of receptors that recognize these proteins on apoptotic cells,
including many that bind PtdSer: Triggering receptor expressed
by myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) (131), CD300 (132), receptor for
advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (133), Stabilin-2 (134),
brain-speciﬁc angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1) (135) and TIM
family members (T cell/transmembrane, immunoglobulin, and
mucin) (136, 137) (Figure 2). For a review of other receptors
recognizing externalized molecules on apoptotic cells see (130).
One PtdSer recognizing receptor family pertinent to the
lung and its susceptibility to bacterial complications is the
TAM receptor family (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk receptors). These
engulfment receptors require bridging molecules to link them to
externalized PtdSer; protein S or growth arrest speciﬁc 6 (Gas6)
(138). MerTK is ubiquitously expressed on macrophages, and
even used as a deﬁning marker for them. Axl, however, shows
a more restricted distribution and is constitutively expressed
on airway macrophages driven by GM-CSF and up-regulated
during viral infection (139). Ligation of TAM receptors, in the
presence of type 1 interferons (IFNs) enhances the expression
of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and SOCS3,
which reduce TLR and cytokine receptor signaling pathways
(140–142). Furthermore, signaling via TAM receptors also
induces TGFβ, IL-10 and prostaglandin production (143–146).
This anti-inﬂammatory airway macrophage state is important to
tolerate self-cells (125) but also reduces responses to subsequent
coinfections (see Figure 2). Expression of IL-10 is raised
following secondary bacterial coinfection after inﬂuenza virus
exposure (147, 148). This is likely designed to prevent further
tissue damage and to allow a return to homeostasis.
Lung viral infection enhances the apoptotic load due to
cytopathology of infected cells and also the requirement to
clear the large recruited immune cell inﬁltrate (149, 150). An
absence of the TAM receptor Axl leads to excessive weight loss
upon inﬂuenza infection in mice (139) that is likely linked to
heightened secondary necrosis, which liberates DAMPS (151)
recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as
RAGE and ST2 (151–153). Axl knockout mice display increased
nucleosome release in the airways corroborating the idea
of enhanced secondary necrosis. This propagation of severe
inﬂammation is likely to damage the lungs further and enhance
the likelihood of secondary bacterial infections. Supporting this
idea, prior exposure of mouse airway macrophages to apoptotic
cells results in suppression of FcR-mediated phagocytosis
and

of
bacteria.
Furthermore,

clearance from the infected lung (154). Also, suppression of
antimicrobial responses of airway macrophages is enhanced by
glucocorticoids, which promote eﬀerocytosis, and treatment
of mice with apoptotic cells in the presence of glucocorticoids
is associated with elevated bacterial burden in the infected
lungs (155).
Therefore, the normal process of clearing dying cells can
have long term consequences and is particularly evident
in chronic lung diseases (156) [for a review see: (157)].

Innate Immune Training in Secondary Infections
FIGURE 2 | Clearance of apoptotic cells impairs anti-bacterial immunity. Removal of apoptotic cells requires their recognition by specialized receptors on phagocytic
cells, including macrophages. In the presence of healthy cells (top left) Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is on the inner leaﬂet of the membrane. Local macrophages do not
recognize them and therefore are able to signal through Toll-like receptors (TLR) unimpeded, resulting in the proinﬂammatory cytokine response. This optimal response
is able to contain and clear bacterial infections (shown in red ovals). However, upon programmed cell death, PtdSer and a variety of other proteins are translocated to
the outside of the cell membrane (top right). Macrophages recognize these exposed proteins via speciﬁc receptors (bottom right). These receptors facilitate apoptotic

between apoptotic recognition receptors and the long term
outcome of their manipulation. Eﬃcient clearance of apoptotic
cells may therefore provide an opportunity for therapeutic
manipulation to lessen the severity of lung viral infections
and
prevent
bacterial
complications.
In
addition
to
the
clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, the phagocytes
themselves (neutrophils and macrophages) may also undergo
apoptosis.
Reduced Responsiveness of PRRs Following Viral
Infection
Another natural process that occurs following viral infection is
the cessation of inﬂammation. This is particularly important to
allow eﬃcient repair. Therefore, a prolonged inhibition of innate
immunity is a common occurrence. However, a timely response
to bacterial infection is critical to limit the pathogen load. Any
delay in early immunity results in logarithmically higher bacterial
loads that are diﬃcult to clear and cause extensive bystander
tissue damage. PRRs are important in this regard, but may be
impaired by previous or concurrent inﬂammatory conditions.
PRRs are widely expressed in the lungs on airway epithelial
cells, alveolar macrophages and DCs and their ligation leads
to the release of cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids and type I
IFNs into the airspaces (158, 159). The kinetics of this initial
inﬂammatory wave limits early pathogen replication (159) by
recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and natural killer (NK)
cells. NK cells target infected airway epithelial cells that have lost
or reduced MHC class I expression (160), whereas monocytes
and neutrophils aid alveolar macrophages in removing infected
dead cells (161) and co-existing bacteria. Furthermore, type I
IFNs stimulate the production of interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs), leading to cell-intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral activity
(162). However, many studies have observed that subsequent
stimulation via PRRs is defective following lung viral infection.
This eﬀect is not restricted to PRRs as defects in multiple
processes employed by the mononuclear phagocyte system have
been observed (69).
Following an acute viral infection, mouse airway macrophages
display a similar phenotype to those in health (CD11c, CD11b,
F4/80, and Siglec F). However, their responsiveness to TLR
agonists is signiﬁcantly dampened (163). We called this “innate
imprinting” in 2004 (164), which is similar to the concept of
“trained immunity” described by others in which monocytes
acquire a tolerant phenotype after stimulation (165–167). This

Innate Immune Training in Secondary Infections
un-responsive state has recently been described as “immune
paralysis” (168). In addition to inﬂuenza virus, human rhinovirus
infection also predisposes to bacterial infection via degradation
of IRAK-1 (interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase) leading to
enhanced infection of respiratory epithelial cells by H. inﬂuenza
(169). Defective TLR signaling would clearly lead to a reduction
in many aspects of inﬂammation. With respect to subsequent
bacterial infections, however, the most damaging consequences
are the IFNγ induced impairment of macrophage phagocytosis
(170, 171) and the reduction in neutrophil recruitment due to
suppressed IL-8 production. In addition to reduced recruitment,
neutrophil function also appears impaired following viral
infection with reported reductions in myeloperoxidase, reactive
oxygen species and the bactericidal properties of neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs) [for a review see (172)]. Reduced
recruitment of neutrophils would also impact on airway
macrophage NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation that is important
for the production of IL-1β (173–176).
Reduced TLR signaling during viral infection may contribute
to the impairment of the IL-17 response required for bacterial
containment. Th17 cells produce IL-17 and IL-22 and are
regulated by IL-23 (177, 178). These cytokines are crucial for
lung epithelial production of neutrophil recruiting chemokines
and anti-microbial peptides (179). Inﬂuenza virus induced type 1
IFNs reduce IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23 and impair the clearance of
S. aureus; an outcome that can be rescued by adenoviral delivery
of IL-23 (180). Type 1 IFNs also impair IL-17 production from γδ
T cells (180).
The anti-inﬂammatory state that occurs following lung viral
infection creates some confusion as patients and mice that
succumb to secondary bacterial infection ultimately display
enhanced inﬂammation (147, 181–183). However, a sluggish
immune response will ultimately lead to enhanced inﬂammation
due to an exponentially higher bacterial load.
The Impact of Viral Infection on Other Airway Innate
Immune Cells
In addition to viral induced modiﬁcation of airway macrophages,
other innate immune cells are also aﬀected. Type-2 innate
lymphoid cells (ILCs) increase during inﬂuenza virus infection
and secrete IL-13 (3), which although important for wound
repair, are not useful during bacterial infection. A similar
population of Lin−CD127+ ST2+ CRTH2+ ILC2s have also
been identiﬁed in human lung tissue and BAL and are known
to produce IL-13. In mice, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus induces IL-13 up to 3 days after inﬂuenza virus infection
and impairs viral clearance. Later infection of MRSA after
inﬂuenza however, exacerbates bacterial replication due to
inhibition of IL-13 and an upregulation of IFNγ (184). A
detrimental impact of IL-13 is also evident following chlamydia
(185) and tuberculosis (186). IL-13 also promotes Mycoplasma
pneumoniae and non-typeable H. inﬂuenza adhesion in cultured
bronchial epithelial cells by increasing MUC18 (187) and
overcomes the enhanced bactericidal eﬀects on epithelial cells
of beta-2 agonists (188). Collectively, these studies suggest that
ILC2s can be beneﬁcial or harmful depending on their kinetics.
Viral infection induces the early recruitment of NK cells to
the lungs where they promote anti-viral immune cells through
the release of cytokines and limit viral replication by removing
infected cells that have down-regulated MHC class I. If NK
cells are depleted, adaptive immunity is not optimal, which
could lead to prolonged viral infection (189, 190). NK cells also
inﬂuence dendritic cells to support Th17 and Th1 cells that
are important in anti-bacterial immunity (191) and NK cell
production of IL-22 is protective against Klebsiella lung infection
(192). However, NK cells appear early in the antiviral response to
lung viral infection and so may not be present during secondary
bacterial infection. Indeed inﬂuenza virus is reported to decrease
NK cells, which reduces clearance of S. aureus in a process
dependent on TNF-mediated enhancement of macrophage
phagocytosis (193).
IL-10 is upregulated by viral infection and dampens the
activation of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells by inhibiting
the production of IL-12 by lung monocyte-derived dendritic
cells, which contributes to S. pneumoniae outgrowth (194).
IFNγ increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection by
promoting inﬂammation and damage in the upper respiratory
tract through both the ligand IFNγ and IFNγ receptor (245).
Though IFNγ stimulates a pro-inﬂammatory phenotype in
alveolar macrophages, it inhibits bacterial phagocytosis (49)
Neutrophils
are
critical
components
of
anti-bacterial
immunity. In addition to their reduced recruitment due to
impaired chemokine production, inﬂuenza virus also inhibits
their activity by inhibiting Th17 cell induction of anti-microbial
peptides (195). Viral induction of Setdb2 (a protein lysine
methyltransferase) also represses the expression of the CXCL1
gene that recruits neutrophils (196) and defective G-CSF
production impairs neutrophil digestion and/or killing of
phagocytized bacteria via myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (197).
γδ T cells are also important in susceptibility to secondary
bacterial infections. These rare T cells directly recognize
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), express a
range of cytokine receptors that modulate their function, mediate
cell cytolysis via FAS and TRAIL and release anti-microbial
peptides and cytotoxic molecules. They also produce IFN-γ,
TNF-α, and IL-17. γδ T cell IL-17 production is impaired during
inﬂuenza infection by type I IFNs causing susceptibility to S.
pneumoniae infection (198). The role of γδ T cells in the extent of
lung inﬂammation during viral infection depends, however, on
whether other underlying conditions are present. For example,
γδ T cell depletion in murine models of rhinovirus infection in
asthmatic mice enhances airway hyper-reactivity (199).
Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells (200, 201) are a
recently studied population that are important in mucosal tissues
for anti-bacterial immunity. They express cytotoxic markers such
as CD107a and granzyme B via synergistic actions of IL-12 and
IL-7 (202) and produce IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17A (203). Their
role in the lung is beginning to emerge. Lower numbers of
peripheral blood CD161(+)Vα7.2(+) MAIT cells are associated
with fatality in hospitalized patients with avian H7N9 inﬂuenza
(204). However, it is not currently known whether defects in this
population may predispose to bacteria following virus infections
in the lung.

Innate Immune Training in Secondary Infections
Wound Repair and Bacterial Susceptibility
in the Airways
In addition to reduced neutrophil chemoattractants, the postviral lung may be skewed toward wound repair that will not be
conducive for bacterial recognition and clearance. The molecules
mediating wound repair are often immune suppressive. IL-10 is
enhanced following inﬂuenza infection and promotes bacterial
replication in the post-inﬂuenza virus infected lung (148) by
inhibiting multiple facets of immunity; a process that may
be driven by the upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
(IDO) (205). Furthermore, regulatory T cells and TGFβ are
raised post-viral infection to dampen inﬂammation and facilitate
processes of wound repair; for example by inducing the synthesis
of collagen (206). However, TGFβ is also anti-inﬂammatory and
is required to limit the activity of dendritic cells (168). A recent
study by the Schulz-Cherry group showed that knockout of the
β6 integrin prevents the activation of latent TGFβ leading to the
presence of constitutively activated airway macrophages (207).
Wound repair therefore represents a double edged sword where
anti-inﬂammatory components limit inﬂammation and promote
repair, but at the same time leave hosts susceptible to bacterial
infection.
A few studies have described that epithelial cell proliferation
and the expression of lung repair genes are reduced following
respiratory viral infection (208, 209). This implies that barrier
repair is delayed, which may prolong the access to alternative
adhesion and nutrition sources for bacteria.
The importance of the repair process in the outcome
of viral and bacterial infection of the respiratory tract is
elegantly illustrated by the administration of amphiregulin,
which decreases inﬂammation and lung damage to inﬂuenza
virus (3) and prevents mortality to a secondary bacterial infection
in the absence of any discernible inﬂuence on bacterial load (208).
Matrix, Innate Immunity, and Bacterial
Adhesion in the Lung
Extracellular matrix is a highly organized structure containing
precise patterning of 43 diﬀerent types of collagen, 200
glycoproteins and 40 proteoglycans (210). These components
combine to form the interstitial matrix and the basement
membrane. Alterations in both of these impacts on the cellular
content of the lung and airways, and the adhesion, growth and
location of bacterial species.
The basement membrane contributes to tissue architecture
and is a highly organized structure made up of collagen
IV, laminins, proteoglycans (decorin, biglycan, aggrecan and
versican), heparan sulfate proteoglycans (perlecan and agrin),
and nidogen (211). Some of these components can bind to other
proteins that have immune modulatory properties. Decorin and
biglycan for example, bind TGF-β1 (212) and so any alteration
of their density or position will impact on lung inﬂammation
and tissue repair. Similarly, ﬁbrillar collagens type I and III of
the interstitial matrix, in addition to binding other collagens
and ECM components, also interact with inﬂammatory cell
surface receptors particularly integrins. VLA-1, for example, is
expressed on inﬂuenza-speciﬁc lung CD8+ T cells and binds
α1β1 on interstitial matrix facilitating retention of memory
CD8+ T cells in the lung (213). It is not hard to imagine that
matrix re-modeling due to viral infection will have numerous
consequences, such as the retention of a higher immune cell
burden (214). Those retained immune cells, however, may not be
optimal for subsequent bacterial infections and may even hinder
the early migration of anti-bacterial immunity. For a recent
review on immune cell:matrix interactions in the lung see (215).
The degradation of matrix can also liberate bioactive
fragments
now
called
matrikines
which
have
immune
modulatory properties. For example, the proteolytic processing
by matrix metalloproteinases, MMP8 and MMP9, of interstitial
collagens liberates the bioactive fragment, acetylated tripeptide
Pro-Gly-Pro (acetyl-PGP) which promotes lung neutrophil
recruitment (216, 217).
Accumulation of extracellular matrix components requires
additional eﬀort from interstitial and alveolar macrophages to
clear them. This renders them hypo-responsive to subsequent
bacteria. Recently we have found that excess hyaluronan
induces adverse events in this way (218). Hyaluronan is a
glycosaminoglycan that is abundant in the lung interstitial
matrix. It is extruded from cells by hyaluronan synthases
forming long cable-like polysaccharide structures. Degradation
of hyaluronan is mediated by hyaluronidases. High- and -low
molecular weight hyaluronan is reported to be anti-inﬂammatory
and
pro-inﬂammatory,
respectively
(219).
Furthermore,
hyaluronan can be sampled in sputum and by bronchoalveolar
lavage, suggesting accumulation in the airways (220, 221). We
have recently reported that hyauronan continues to accumulate
in the lung and airway long after resolution of acute inﬂuenza
virus infection in mice due to excess production via HA synthase
2. Furthermore, this excess hyaluronan is cross-linked with
inter-α-inhibitor heavy chains due to elevated TNF-stimulated
gene 6 expression. IαI is a proteoglycan containing two heavy
chains of ∼80 kDa, and a light chain (bikunin) of ∼25 kDa that
confers protease inhibitory properties (222, 223). Circulating
IαI leaks into tissues during inﬂammation. Its synthesis has also
been described in lung epithelia where it mediates repair after
lung injury (224). In our study, administration of intranasal
hyaluronidase completely restored lung function without any
deleterious side eﬀects (218).
There are other examples of matrix alterations contributing
to the pathogenesis of lung viral infections (225). Inﬂuenza
infection induces the recruitment of myeloid cells expressing
membrane type I matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP/MMP14) that is important in lung development and homeostasis
(226). MT1-MMP inhibition rescues tissue damage and mortality
in inﬂuenza-infected mice and combined with the anti-viral,
oseltamivir, aﬀords complete recovery. Furthermore, MT1-MMP
inhibition also prevents outgrowth of S. pneumoniae following
inﬂuenza infection (227). The modulation of extracellular matrix
may depend on the viral strain. Analysis of RNA datasets
from patients infected with pandemic associated inﬂuenza
strains shows that H5N1 and H7N9 infection are enriched
for genes involved with the extracellular matrix pathway
(228). The importance of lung recovery and resilience is
also demonstrated in mice lacking endophilin B2 that display

Innate Immune Training in Secondary Infections
improved mechanosensing and collagen and elastin ECM
remodeling compared to wild-type mice (229). There are many
other examples where matrix and associated components impact
on lung immunity, which have been comprehensively reviewed
elsewhere (230).
In addition to viruses directly promoting bacterial adherence
(e.g., the neuraminidase in inﬂuenza virus exposes bacterial
attachment sites by cleaving sialic acids, which are also
metabolized by bacteria as a food source (231)), viral induced
changes in extracellular matrix will change the lung microbiome.
Dysbiosis of microbial commensalism can signiﬁcantly impact
on the overall health and progression of disease. Bacteria and
bacterial products induce phenotypic and functional changes in
immune pro-inﬂammatory gene expression, cellular adhesion
and migration, and cell death (232). Binding to the ECM allows
bacteria to adhere to, and colonize, host tissue. In addition,
bacteria demonstrate aﬃnity for diﬀerent matrix substrates
and changes in ECM components may increase host-pathogen
accessibility and increase of bacterial virulence (233).
A number of microbes have elastase activity and/or express
binding proteins for elastin that aid their pathogenicity (234). S
aureus binds to elastin rich sites and expresses elastin binding
proteins (EbpS) which bind to soluble, but not structurally intact
chains of elastin (234). The expression of EbpS is also associated
with greater bacterial cell growth, promoting cell proliferation
and colonization (234, 235) and evasion of phagocytosis (234). In
addition, elastin proteolytic products induce MMP activity and a
number of bacteria express elastases (234, 235) further promoting
elastin availability and consequently bacterial binding.
S. aureus encodes the ﬁbronectin binding proteins (FnBPs),
MSCRAMM (microbial surface component recognizing adhesive
matrix molecule) that adhere to ﬁbronectin and ﬁbrinogen
(236). Since components of ﬁbronectin inﬂuence TLR4 receptor
signaling, FnBPs may also promote immune regulation (237).
Bacteria express collagen receptors and their binding appears
to depend on collagen ﬁber tensile strength, conformation
and structural dynamics. In an in vitro model, applying
increasing high tensile forces to collagen peptides restricts
receptor binding, suggesting that structurally normal collagen
ﬁbers decrease available sites for bacterial adhesion. Injured
states, where collagen ﬁbers are cleaved by high MMP activity,
may increase susceptibility toward bacterial colonization with
reduced structural strength and increased accessibility for more
bacterial binding capacity (238).
Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a large multimeric adhesion
molecule and stimulates adhesion of bacteria. In bacteria such as
S aureus, adherence to host can also be mediated via vWF and
bacterial binding protein staphylococcal protein A (SPA). SPA
binds to soluble and insoluble forms of vWF, promoting bacterial
attachment and enhancing virulence in the absence of immune
cell detection and clearance (239).
Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions are ubiquitously used
for cellular and extracellular signaling in all biological processes.
Microbes utilize this universal process of the host for binding,
and colonization of the host environment. Bacteria express GAG
species and diﬀerent binding domains across their entire surface.
Studies blocking, removing or decreasing expression of these
GAG binding domains decrease bacterial virulence (attachment,
colonization and infection) in a number of bacterial strains
(240). Bacterial communities have diﬀerent aﬃnities for GAG
species (240). A large study manipulating GAG binding domains
showed that the removal of heparin sulfate in S. aureus and
S. pneumoniae decreases bacterial attachment to lung epithelial
cells and ﬁbroblasts and the inhibition of synthesis produced
the same eﬀect (240). The normal GAG interactions of the host
are also used by microbes to prevent immune detection and
clearance. Bacteria such as Streptococcus coat their surface with
soluble high molecular weight hyaluronan, inhibiting detection
and clearance by macrophages (241). Degradation of hyaluronan
from the host tissues or bacteria into the low molecular
weight protein stimulates phagocytosis, demonstrating bacterial
colonization and infection can be inﬂuenced by the processing of
GAGs from both the bacterium and host (241).
Fast Inﬂammation Is Good
Interestingly, a time limited burst of inﬂammation from the
outset is beneﬁcial during inﬂuenza infection in mice, which
results in faster clearance and less collateral damage (Figure 3).
The evidence to support this comes from detailed studies on
IL-10 knockout mice and the response to pathogen clearance
discussed earlier, and our studies with CD200 or CD200R
knockout mice. CD200R signaling on myeloid cells limits
inﬂammatory activity (242). Mice lacking CD200 or CD200R
show heightened weight loss during inﬂuenza infection due to
raised levels of inﬂammation (47). However, when these mice are
next exposed to S. pneumoniae, they do not show susceptibility,
because the ﬁrst inﬂammatory event to inﬂuenza was quicker,
thus causing less collateral damage (243). The beneﬁt of a short
FIGURE 3 | Fast and limited immunity is good. A time limited burst of
inﬂammation limits bystander tissue damage, which in turn limits the extent of
tissue repair. This leads to less impairment of anti-bacterial immunity and so a
secondary bacterial infection is cleared. A virulent pathogen, or one that isn’t
cleared quickly, causes prolonged bystander tissue damage leading to a
lengthy period of repair; the processes of which are anti-inﬂammatory. A
subsequent bacterial infection is ignored and grows exponentially. Ultimately,
innate immunity is activated when the bacterial load is excessive causing
deleterious consequences.

Morgan et al.
Innate Immune Training in Secondary Infections
burst of inﬂammation has recently been supported by data from
the Metzger group where mice lacking SOCS-1 or IFNγ cleared
inﬂuenza virus faster than littermate controls due to a rapid
induction of immunity. By contrast, in the presence of SOCS-1,
inﬂammation was prolonged and collateral damage increased
(171). It would be interesting to test the impact of subsequent
respiratory bacterial infection in the SOCS1 and IFNγ deﬁcient
model. Such studies might suggest that patients experiencing
severe disease do so because their immune system is too sluggish.
However, upon presentation at care facilities it would be too late
to consider boosting immunity. The speed of immunity could
possibly be speciﬁcally tackled in patients with other underlying
conditions that render their innate immune system suppressed,
as in the case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or of
the wrong phenotype to limit viral replication, as in the case of
asthma. These patient groups are known to be at risk of severe
viral infections [for example see (244, 245)].
The beneﬁts of rapid induction of immunity to viral infection
are also supported by research on IL-22. IL-22 is an interesting
cytokine that is produced by innate immune cells and is critical
for host protective immunity to lung K. pneumoniae (246), and
S. aureus (183), but not to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M.
avium infection (164). IL-22 is upregulated during lung infection,
but its neutralization has no eﬀect on the kinetics of the disease
or viral clearance. Rather it seems to function by promoting
epithelial integrity and limiting lung damage (3, 247–249), which
in turn prevents secondary lung infections by S. pneumoniae
in mice (250). Interestingly, progesterone treatment of female
mice also induces heightened IL-22 (and TGFβ and IL-6) and
promotes faster recovery from inﬂuenza infection in female
mice via epithelial production of amphiregulin. The resultant
improvement of pulmonary function and reduced protein
leakage is likely to diminish the risk of bacterial outgrowth,
though this was not tested (251). In murine models of inﬂuenza
infection, administration of GM-CSF promotes resistance to S.
pneumoniae by promoting neutrophil recruitment and reactive
oxygen species production from macrophages (252).
Another study that supports stimulation of immunity to
prevent bacterial super-infections showed that the TLR-2
agonist, macrophage-activating lipopeptide 2 (MALP-2), reduces
pneumococcal outgrowth in inﬂuenza virus infected mice
(253). Also administration of nanoparticles containing the coat
protein of a plant virus (papaya mosaic virus) and a singlestranded RNA causes the rapid recruitment of neutrophils,
monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes with beneﬁcial eﬀects
on inﬂuenza virus and subsequent S. pneumoniae infection (254).
Creating a Debate in Matrix Modulation
Matrix modulation research is a ﬁeld with great potential in
restoring immune function via alternative key mechanisms.
Extracellular matrix production is elevated following severe acute
viral infection, which could have consequences on cell retention,
immune paralysis of phagocytic cells and the physical properties
of the airspaces into which it leaks. Respiratory ﬂuids from
COPD patients for example, contain higher levels of hyaluronan
(HA) than healthy controls (59, 218) and we have recently
shown this is exacerbated further by viral infection in COPD
patients. Hyaluronidase treatment of mice after resolution of
inﬂuenza virus infection restores lung function suggesting that
the consequences of increased airway and lung hyaluronan is
an impaired lung physiology (218). Airway hyper-reactivity is
also improved during ozone-induced airway disease in CD44
or IαI deﬁcient mice (60, 255) that bind HA or cross-link it,
respectively. TNF-stimulated gene 6 catalyzes the transfer of IαI
heavy chains onto HA (256) and TSG-6 null mice are resistant
to airway hyporesponsiveness (257). Also TSG-6 promotes
anti-inﬂammatory macrophages, (258) and inhibits neutrophil
recruitment (259–262) and NFκB nuclear translocation. Just
considering one matrix protein such as hyaluronan, the method
of its production and degradation and the proteins that cross
link it, provides multiple avenues for modulation. Therapeutic
development in this area, to our knowledge, is poor with most
focus on neutralizing enzymes that degrade matrix to prevent
the liberation of small chemotactic matrix products. However,
recombinant human hyaluronidase is licensed for therapeutic
use in humans to increase barrier permeability, and although
it is currently approved to enhance delivery and absorption
of subcutaneous anesthetics, increase uptake of ﬂuids, and to
improve resorption of radiopaque agents (263, 264), it has
the potential to be used to improve inﬂammatory diseases by
immune-matrix modulation.
CONCLUSION
Bacterial susceptibility following lung viral infection has been
recognized for over a century and yet treatment options have
not really altered since the introduction of antibiotics. It is now
clear that long term suppression of innate immune mechanisms
occurs following severe acute or chronic inﬂammation. In
contrast to the clinical susceptibility toward bacterial infection
that can occur in the 7 days following a viral infection, there
are multiple long term modiﬁcations in immune mechanisms
long after severe viral infections. These changes re-set the
inﬂammatory tone of various immune cells by processes now
known as trained immunity, innate imprinting or immune
paralysis (164–166, 168). These molecular changes are evident
during peak infection, but not in naïve un-infected lungs. This
modiﬁed, tardy innate immunity immune response contributes
to dysregulation of immune mechanisms to secondary bacterial
exposure, rather than the clearance of the initial pathogen,
and hence may explain the higher risk of long term bacterial
outgrowth and chronic infection that cumulatively leads to
excessive inﬂammatory disease. The majority of pathways leading
to bacterial complications following viral infection have been
discovered in single mouse strain studies. A recent report from
the Metzger group shows that diﬀerent mouse strains (BALB/C
and C57BL/6) react diﬀerently to alveolar macrophage depletion
following acute inﬂuenza infection. BALB/c mice respond to an
acute inﬂuenza insult via IFNγ dependent alveolar macrophage
depletion, whereas C57BL/6 mice do not. However, both are
susceptible to post-viral bacterial coinfection (265). The precise
combination of changes leading to bacterial super-infection may
therefore be slightly diﬀerent depending on genetic background.

Innate Immune Training in Secondary Infections
Another area that requires development is that the known
“at risk” patient groups currently identiﬁed for priority
inﬂuenza vaccination (the elderly, asthmatic, pregnant etc.)
do not account for the vast hospitalization numbers over the
winter seasons. This suggests there may be other “at risk”
groups.
This as exempliﬁed by the rise of bacterial pneumonias in
those experiencing low mood, stress, anxiety or mental health
issues (266, 267). A mucosal barrier breach cannot explain
all infectious complications. A population-based Danish study
of 976,398 individuals, including 142,169 with a history of
depression, onset of depression was associated with increased
respiratory viral or bacterial complications (IRR = 1.58; CI =
1.36–1.85; p = 0.000) (268). Depression and stress are linked to
suppression of multiple arms of innate and adaptive immunity
[see (269) and references within], including a reduction of
neutrophils (270) that are important for bacterial clearance. The
link between mental health and infection is an area that will gain
momentum in the next few years. Another area of concern that
will likely garner research eﬀort in the future is the inﬂuence of
polypharmacy on respiratory infectious risk. In elderly patients
hospitalized for pneumonia in Canada, 45% were taking 5 or
more medications prior to hospital admission (271). A number
of these medications may also modulate the immune system,
though research in this area is sparse.
There is a window of opportunity between recovery from
viral infection and the onset of bacterial outgrowth where innate
immunity could be primed to react quicker. This may involve
removal of immune suppressive pathways (CD200R, IL-10, and
TGFβ), facilitation of apoptotic cell clearance (as apoptotic cell
recognition receptors switch oﬀinnate immunity) or timely
removal of high molecular weight matrix components from the
airways. To identify these, studies are required that take into
account other comorbidities, mental health status and the impact
of polypharmacy on outcome.

Acute respiratory infections by inﬂuenza viruses are commonly causes of severe
pneumonia, which can further deteriorate if secondary bacterial infections occur.
Although the viral and bacterial agents are quite diverse, defensins, a set of antimicrobial
peptides expressed by the host, may provide promising biomarkers that would greatly
improve the diagnosis and treatment. We examined the correlations between the gene
expression levels of defensins and the viral and bacterial loads in the blood on a
longitudinal, precision-medical study of a severe pneumonia patient infected by inﬂuenza
A H7N9 virus. We found that DEFA5 is positively correlated to the blood load of inﬂuenza
A H7N9 virus (r = 0.735, p < 0.05, Spearman correlation). DEFB116 and DEFB127 are
positively and DEFB108B and DEFB114 are negatively correlated to the bacterial load.
Then the diagnostic potential of defensins to discriminate bacterial and viral infections
was evaluated on an independent dataset with 61 bacterial pneumonia patients and
39 viral pneumonia patients infected by inﬂuenza A viruses and reached 93% accuracy.
Expression levels of defensins in the blood may be of important diagnostic values in clinic
to indicate viral and bacterial infections.

INTRODUCTION
Acute respiratory infections by inﬂuenza viruses are commonly the causes of severe pneumonia,
which can further deteriorate if secondary bacterial infections occur (McCullers, 2014). Accurate
detection of inﬂuenza virus infections and the potential secondary bacterial infections is important
to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe pneumonia. Because the viral and
bacterial agents are quite diverse, seeking a broad-spectrum test based on only the characteristics
of pathogens is currently still a challenging task. Although the rapidly developed next-generation
sequencing (NGS) technology provides a powerful tool to catalog the taxonomic composition of
clinical samples, the great technological complexity and high price makes it hard to adopt in clinic
soon. Identifying biomarkers that can be readily adopted into clinic is urgently needed. Because
diﬀerent pathogens can result in convergent host responses, identifying broad-spectrum diagnostic
biomarkers from the host response is probable. With the rapid development of high-throughput
biomedical technologies, the gene expression proﬁles of host blood can now be readily obtained.

Defensins Correlate to Bacterial/Viral Infection
Recently several groups have reported in succession that the
gene expression proﬁles of a certain set of genes in the
human blood can robustly discriminate bacterial infections from
viral infections and a series of bioinformatics tools have been
developed to identify the associations between microbes and host
health (Ramilo et al., 2007; Edelman et al., 2009; Zaas et al., 2009;
Parnell et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2013; Mejias et al., 2013; Peng et al.,

Defensins Correlate to Bacterial/Viral Infection
compartments of the body (Ganz, 2003). These great properties
of defensins indicate that they may be good candidates of
diagnostic biomarkers to discriminate bacterial/viral infections.
However, the currently reported gene signatures identiﬁed with
human blood gene expression proﬁles seldom include defensins.
It is of pressing need to ﬁnd out the clinically diagnostic values of
defensins.
To reach the objective, we proﬁled the gene expression levels
in blood and the viral and bacterial loads in plasma of a severe
pneumonia patient infected by inﬂuenza A H7N9 virus via
the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology along with
the disease progression. Then we examined the correlations
between the expression levels of defensins and the viral and
bacterial loads in the blood. Although many defensins did not
demonstrate statistically signiﬁcant correlations with either the
viral or the bacterial loads, the p-values of several defensins
did reach the statistical signiﬁcance cutoﬀafter multipletesting corrections. And these statistically signiﬁcant defensins
demonstrated mutually exclusive correlations with the viral loads
and the bacterial loads, suggesting that defensins are of great
diagnostic values to discriminate viral and bacterial infections.
Upon this observation, we then examined the diagnostic
potential of defensins on an independent dataset with 61 bacterial
pneumonia patients and 39 viral pneumonia patients infected
by inﬂuenza A viruses (Parnell et al., 2012) via a machine
learning method, which conﬁrmed again that defensins are of
great diagnostic values to discriminate bacterial infections from
viral infections. These results suggest that expression levels of
defensins in the blood may be of important diagnostic values in
clinic to indicate viral and bacterial infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Longitudinal Gene Expression Proﬁles of a
Severe Pneumonia Patient Infected by
Inﬂuenza a H7N9 Virus
The severe pneumonia patient infected by inﬂuenza A H7N9
virus was admitted to hospital on Day 5 after illness onset and
died on Day 29. Since Day 6, blood samples were collected for
every three days, i.e., on Days 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27
after illness onset. The total RNA was isolated and then subjected
to sequencing on Illumina Solexa GA II with read length of
80 bp (see Hu et al., 2015 for the technical details). Cuﬄinks
(version 2.1.1, with default parameters) (Trapnell et al., 2010)
was used to quantify the gene expression proﬁles of defensins
after mapping the quality-controlled reads to human genome
(GRCh37 and Gencode19) using Tophat (version 2.0.10, with
default parameters) (Kim et al., 2013). This study was reviewed
and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of
Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and
Peking Union Medical College. Written informed consent was
obtained for the use of peripheral blood samples from the
patient’s relatives. This study was carried out in accordance
with the recommendations of the Institute of Pathogen Biology,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical
College. The protocol was approved by the Institute of Pathogen

Quantifying the Microbial Species Infecting
in the Blood Samples
To quantify the microbial species infecting in the blood
samples, a metagenomic analysis method was applied. In detail,
the same sequencing reads were aligned to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide database by BLASTN (version 2.2.22,
with parameters “-e 1e-10 –b 10 –v 10”) (Altschul et al.,
1997). Then, the results were parsed and visualized by the
MEGAN software (Huson et al., 2007, 2016; Mitra et al., 2011),
upon which those reads speciﬁcally mapped to bacterial or
viral genomes were counted and exported as the bacterial/viral

viral/bacterial loads. Speciﬁcally, given the expression levels of
a defensin at all the eight time points xi where i = 1, ..., 8
and the normalized loads of a speciﬁc bacterial/viral species yj
wherej = 1, ..., 8, ranks rx and ry were ﬁrstly obtained and then
the correlation was calculated according to the following formula:
rxy = cov(rx, ry)
σrxσry
(1)
Where cov(rx, ry) is the covariance of the rank variables and σrx
and σry are the standard deviations of the rank variables. For each
pair of defensin and microbial species, the corresponding p-value
was also calculated, which was further subject to multiple testing
correction by the Benjamini and Hochberg method.
Validating the Diagnostic Value of
Defensins On Independent Datasets
An independent cohort of 100 pneumonia patients (61 bacterial
and 39 viral) were used to validate the diagnostic value
of defensins and associated genes (NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus, access number: GSE40012) (Parnell et al., 2012).
The whole blood gene expression proﬁles were quantiﬁed by
Illumina HT-12 gene-expression beadarrays. Expression levels of
defensins and associated genes were then extracted for clustering
and classiﬁcation analysis. For clustering analysis, t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (van der Maaten and
Hinton, 2008) was ﬁrst used to reduce the dimensionality of the
data to two for visualization and then a clustering method based
on searching density peaks (Rodriguez and Laio, 2014) was used
to cluster the samples into two groups. For classiﬁcation analysis,
the popular random forest method (Breiman, 2001) was used to
evaluate the diagnostic value via a leave-one-out cross-validation
method. The diagnostic value of defensins and associated
genes was further validated on two additional independent
datasets. One dataset included 12 children’s admitted to
Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus infections
and 10 children’s admitted to viral infections by inﬂuenza viruses
(NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, access number: GSE6269)
(Ramilo et al., 2007). The other dataset included 67 bacterial and
113 viral infections for adults (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus,
access number: GSE63990) (Tsalik et al., 2016).
RESULTS
Evident Associations of Different
Defensins to the Bacterial And Viral Loads
of H7N9 Pneumonia Patients
It is evident that inﬂuenza H7N9 virus demonstrated two peaks
in the patient blood (from Day 6 to Day 12 and from Day
18 to Day 24), with days from Day 12 to Day 18 forming
a valley (Figure 1A). However, at Day 18, a huge peak of
Acinetobacter baumannii infection appeared which declined in
the following days with small ﬂuctuations (Figure 1A). The total
of 30 defensins measured (4 α and 26 β defensins) were all
expressed in at least one sample or more (Table 1). Most of the
defensins except DEFA5, DEFB116, DEFB127, DEFB114, and
DEFB108B did not show correlations to or only showed weak
correlations to viral/bacterial loads in blood that were statistically
not signiﬁcant (Figure 1B). DEFA5 was positively correlated to
the blood load of inﬂuenza A H7N9 virus (r = 0.735, p < 0.05,
Spearman correlation), which also showed two peaks similar
to those of the virus (Figure 1A). But DEFA5 did not show
correlations to the bacterial load. Diﬀerent from DEFA5,
DEFB116 and DEFB127 were positively correlated to the
blood load of Acinetobacter baumannii (r = 0.881 and 0.810, p
< 0.05), both of which showed two peaks with one consistent
with the peak of Acinetobacter baumannii and another at Day
6 (Figure 1A). The peak at Day 6 may indicate latent bacterial
infection that was undetectable in blood, suggesting potentially
superior sensitivity of defensin-based diagnostics. DEFB114 and
DEFB108B showed negative correlations with Acinetobacter
baumannii (r = −0.731 and −0.786, p < 0.05, Spearman
correlation, Figures 1A,B).
Diagnostic Values of Defensins On an
Independent Pneumonia Cohort
On the independent validation dataset, we ﬁrst extracted the
expression proﬁles of defensins and associated genes and
conducted t-SNE for visualization. It is obvious that bacterial
and viral pneumonia patients separately formed clusters with a
few exceptions (Figure 2, left). Clustering analysis grouped the
patients into two classes, one of which corresponded to bacterial
pneumonia and the other corresponded to viral pneumonia
(Figure 2, middle). The accuracy of clustering analysis reached
82%, with 18 patients mis-clustered. Clustering based on the
raw high-dimensional data resulted in similar results, suggesting
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org

Zhou et al.
Defensins Correlate to Bacterial/Viral Infection
that bacterial and viral infections caused diﬀerent responses
for defensins and associated genes in blood. When switching
the algorithms from unsupervised to supervised, high accuracy
(93%), AUC (0.97), sensitivity (0.98), speciﬁcity (0.82), precision
(0.90), and F1-score (0.94) were achieved by a random forest
classiﬁer with default parameters (Figure 2, right), suggesting
the potential of defensin-based diagnostics to discriminate
viral/bacterial infections.
Among the 87 defensins and associated genes that had
expression values available, DEFA4 and DEFA3 were the
most signiﬁcantly diﬀerentially expressing defensins between
bacterial and viral pneumonia patients. Both of these two
defensins are alpha defensins and highly expressed in viral
pneumonia patient blood (Figure 3, upper). The p-values tested
by Wilcoxin rand-sum test were 7.96 × 10−6 and 2.89 ×
10−6 for DEFA4 and DEFA3, respectively. DEFB107A was
signiﬁcantly highly expressed in bacterial pneumonia patient
blood (Figure 3, lower left, p = 0.0055, Wilcoxin rand-sum
test). MX1 is the most signiﬁcant defensin-associated gene
diﬀerentially expressed between bacterial and viral pneumonia
(Figure 3, lower right, p = 1.07 × 10−9, Wilcoxin rand-sum
test).
Evaluations on two additional datasets (GSE6269 and
GSE63990) conﬁrmed the diagnostic power of defensins
and associated genes (Figure 4). On the dataset GSE6269,
the accuracy can reach 95% while the AUC, sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, precision, and F1-score are 0.96, 1, 0.9, 0.92,
and 0.96, respectively. On the dataset GSE63990, similar
performance was obtained, with accuracy 89%, AUC 0.94,
sensitivity 0.84, speciﬁcity 0.93, precision 0.88 and F1-score
0.85.
DISCUSSION
Accurate discrimination of bacterial and viral infections has
important clinical values and can inform clinicians to properly
select therapies. Identifying biomarkers that can accurately
classify bacterial infections from viral infections is thus of
great importance. Blood-based assays including microarrays
and next-generation sequencing provide a quite convenient
method to quantify the expression levels of various genes,
which form a rich resource for determination of biomarkers
discriminating bacterial and viral infections. Multiple studies
have been completed to seek such biomarkers from human
blood gene expression proﬁles (Zaas et al., 2009; Parnell et al.,
2012; Hu et al., 2013, 2015; Suarez et al., 2015). However, the
values of defensins are often overlooked. Defensins, which are a
major family of antimicrobial peptides expressed predominantly
in neutrophils and epithelial cells and play important roles
in innate immune defense against infectious pathogens, are
hypothesized by us to action in distinct ways when combating
against bacterial and viral infections, and thus we conducted this
study.
We addressed the diagnostic values of defensins through two
ways. Firstly, we checked the associations between human blood
defensin mRNAs and the bacterial and viral loads through a
continuous follow-up of a pneumonia patient caused by infection
of inﬂuenza A H7N9 virus. This longitudinal study revealed
that bacterial and viral loads were associated to beta and alpha
defensins, respectively, among which several defensins showed
impressing statistical signiﬁcance. Secondly, we re-analyzed the
diagnostic values of defensins on an independent dataset, which
quantiﬁed blood gene expression proﬁles of 100 pneumonia
patients including 61 bacterial and 39 viral infections. This lateral
study demonstrated again the diagnostic power of defensins
for discriminating bacterial and viral infections. Both studies
remind that defensins and associated genes have great diagnostic
potentials which deserve further investigation in the future.
Although, the statistically signiﬁcant defensins in these two
studies did not overlap well, they could be caused or at least
explained by the diﬀerent study types and proﬁling techniques
(microarray-based or NGS-based). Further studies were needed
to exclude the technical interference and to include more
biological variance.
We also compared the defensin-based biomarkers with
published biomarker panels. We noticed that MX1 appeared
multiple times across the studies, consistent with its great
diﬀerence between bacterial and viral infections. Other defensins
and associated genes are reported for the ﬁrst time to have
diagnostic power to discriminate bacterial from viral infections,
and thus may provide new insights into the infection mechanisms
and serve as important tools for clinical diagnosis. Because innate
immunity is the ﬁrst frontier of host to combat pathogens, the
diﬀerences of defensins and associated genes during bacterial and
viral infections may suggest that prominent patterns exist in host
innate immune responses and defensins are valid representative
molecules.
In summary, defensins not only are important molecules for
hosts to combat infections, but also may provide promising
biomarkers to indicate the types of infectious agents, which
is expected to of signiﬁcant clinical utility and needs further
investigations.

It is unknown how the respiratory microbiome inﬂuences and is inﬂuenced by bacterial
pneumonia in dogs, as culture of lung samples and not microbial sequencing guides
clinical practice. While accurate identiﬁcation of pathogens are essential for treatment,
not all bacteria are cultivable and the impact of respiratory dysbiosis on development of
pneumonia is unclear. The study purposes were to (1) characterize the lung microbiome
in canine bacterial pneumonia and compare deviations in dominant microbial populations
with historical healthy controls, (2) compare bacteria identiﬁed by culture vs. 16S
rDNA sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid (BALF) culture-, and (3) evaluate
similarities in lung and oropharyngeal (OP) microbial communities in community-acquired
and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Twenty BALF samples from 15 client-owned
dogs diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia were enrolled. From a subset of dogs,
OP swabs were collected. Extracted DNA underwent PCR of the 16S rRNA gene.
Relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined. The relative
abundance of bacterial community members found in health was decreased in dogs
with pneumonia. Taxa identiﬁed via culture were not always the dominant phylotype
identiﬁed with sequencing. Dogs with community-acquired pneumonia were more likely
to have overgrowth of a single organism suggesting loss of dominant species associated
with health. Dogs with secondary bacterial pneumonia had a greater regional continuity
between the upper and lower airways. Collectively, these data suggest that dysbiosis
occurs in canine bacterial pneumonia, and culture-independent techniques may provide
greater depth of understanding of the changes in bacterial community composition that
occur in disease.

INTRODUCTION
Canine bacterial pneumonia is a common respiratory disorder, occurring as primary disease
process, or secondary to aspiration, viral infections (1, 2), immunodeﬁciency, or a nosocomial event
(3). In both humans and companion animals, bacterial pneumonia can be life-threatening making
prompt diagnosis and targeted treatment essential. Diagnostic approaches to identify the causative

agents have traditionally relied on ex vivo culture from
carefully collected airway lavage [e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage
ﬂuid (BALF)]. This method is predicated on the belief that
the deep airways are largely free of bacteria and any growth
on selective media represents aberrant colonization. The recent
development of culture-independent molecular techniques has
revealed that in humans (4), cats (5), dogs (6), sheep (7), and
likely other host species, the healthy lungs harbor low biomass
microbial populations seeded via direct extension from upper
airway communities, repeated microaspiration, and inhalation of
bacteria in air (8). Moreover, these culture-independent methods
have reinforced that a lack of cultivable organisms does not
necessarily indicate a sterile environment (9). Collectively, such
ﬁndings suggest that sequencing methods might have clinical
utility in the identiﬁcation of microbes associated with bacterial
pneumonia. Toward that end, the current study compared the
results of traditional culture-based methods and a targeted
sequencing approach applied to 20 BALF samples collected from
15 dogs aﬀected with bacterial pneumonia in a referral veterinary
hospital setting.
Canine
bacterial
pneumonia
is
categorized
as
either
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or secondary bacterial
pneumonia (SBP) based on the etiology, clinical presentation,
and patient history. As the name implies, CAP is typiﬁed by
known contagious pathogens, such as Bordetella bronchiseptica
and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus and is often
seen in dogs with a history of acute onset clinical signs
following exposure to reservoirs of infectious agents, such as
shelters, boarding facilities, and dog parks (10, 11). Secondary
bacterial pneumonia, on the other hand, occurs as a sequela
to a predisposing anatomic or physiological condition, such as
megaesophagus, laryngeal paralysis, or ciliary dyskinesia (12),
and the microbes recovered in a diagnostic sample are often
not primary contagious pathogens, per se. Rather, dysfunction
of the upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal tract allows
or facilitates increased translocation of material to the lower
airways and/or prevents eﬀective microbial clearance, leading
to the hypothesis that the lower and upper airway microbiota
would be more similar in cases of SBP relative to cases of
CAP. To address this question, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were
collected from a subset of dogs alongside BALF samples and
the compositional similarity of OP and BALF microbiota was
evaluated in the context of clinical diagnoses and predisposing
anatomic factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Design
The current study was performed prospectively at the University
of Missouri Veterinary Health Center (VHC), a referral and
primary care veterinary hospital located in Columbia, MO, USA.
All dogs contributing samples to the current study presented
to the VHC with clinical signs related to bacterial pneumonia

between August 2016 and December 2017. Bronchoscopic
examination and diagnostic collection of BALF were performed
as part of their standard care. Peripheral blood was also collected
at presentation for hematologic and serum chemistry analyses.
Dogs were then diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia based on
clinical signs associated with septic suppurative inﬂammation
or a positive aerobic or anaerobic culture result of BALF, and
categorized by type of pneumonia based on the history, clinical
signs and other diagnostic ﬁndings. Dogs were of various breeds
and ages; a table showing the range of patient demographics is
provided in Table 2.
Sample Collection
Anesthetic protocols were performed at the discretion of a board
certiﬁed veterinary anesthesiologist. Samples were collected as
previously described (5). Brieﬂy, after induction for anesthesia,
while avoiding the rest of the oral cavity, a sterile swab was
used to vigorously rub the caudodorsal aspect of the oropharynx,
from a subset of patients (see Table 1). The swab was added
to 800 µL lysis buﬀer adapted from Yu and Morrison (13).
Dogs were initially intubated using sterile endotracheal tubes.
Control samples were obtained by running a 10 ml aliquot of
sterile saline through the endoscope channel before its use.
Immediately prior to the bronchoscopy, the endotracheal tube
was replaced with a sterile red rubber catheter to provide
oxygen and the endoscope was passed directly through the
larynx into the tracheobronchial tree. BALF collection was
performed by instilling one or two 20 mL aliquots of sterile saline
through the channel of a sterile bronchoscope when wedged
in an airway. All dogs provided one BALF sample with the
following exceptions: dog I provided one sample on 1/12/2017
(I1) and two samples from the left and right lung lobes in on
11/2016 (I2 and I3, respectively), dog M provided samples on
11/4 and 12/20 of 2016 (M1 and M2), and dog G provided
samples on 11/11, 12/1, and 12/21 of 2016 (G1, G2, and G3,
respectively). Following collection of BALF, samples were split
to provide a minimum of 1 mL of material to the University of
Missouri Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory for culture
on Blood agar and MacConkey agar plates for aerobic cultures,
and chocolate agar plates for anaerobic cultures. All aerobic
samples were incubated at 35◦C, and anaerobic cultures were
incubated at 35◦C with 95% air and 5% CO2 for 24–36 h. The
laboratory does not culture Mycoplasma spp. in large part due to
challenging growth requirements. Bacterial isolates were Gramstained and identiﬁed with conventional biochemical reactions
(14), the Automated Sensititre AP-80 or AP 90 for aerobic
bacteria or the MALDI-TOF identiﬁcation system (Matrix
Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight: Bruker
Daltonics, Inc. 40 Manning Road, Manning Park, Billerica,
MA 01821). Aerobic susceptibility testing was performed with
the Sensititre Micro-Broth (Thermoﬁsher Scientiﬁc 12076 Santa
Fe Drive, Lenexa, KS 66215) dilution minimal inhibitory
concentration system. Up to 30 mL of the remaining BALF
material was promptly centrifuged, and the resulting pellet
was frozen and maintained at −80◦C until DNA extraction
was performed.

DNA Extraction
To maximize yields, DNA was ﬁrst extracted using a manual
nucleic acid precipitation, followed by resuspension of DNA in
buﬀer and puriﬁcation using DNeasy kits (Qiagen) according
to manufacturer’s instructions with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy,
BALF was ﬁrst centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at room
temperature, followed by removal of the supernatant and
resuspension in 800 µL lysis buﬀer as adapted from Yu and
Morrison (13). Samples were then incubated at 70◦C for 20 min
with periodic mixing and centrifuged as before. Next, 10 mM
ammonium acetate (200 µL) was added to the supernatant and
samples were incubated on ice for 5 min, before centrifugation
at 5,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Up to 750 µL of
the supernatant was then mixed with an equal volume of chilled
isopropanol and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were then
centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4◦C. Precipitated nucleic
acids were then washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in 150
µL Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA), and processed
according to the DNeasy kit’s manufacturer’s instructions, with
the following modiﬁcation. Instead of eluting in the AE buﬀer
provided with the kits, DNA was eluted in the comparable,
but EDTA-free, EB buﬀer (Qiagen). Yields were determined via
ﬂuorometry (Qubit 2.0) using Qubit dsDNA BR assays (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Samples were stored at −20◦C until
library preparation was performed.
16S rRNA Library Preparation and
Sequencing
Library construction and sequencing were performed at the
University of Missouri DNA Core facility, as previously
described (6). Brieﬂy, 16S rRNA amplicons were generated via
ampliﬁcation of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using
single-indexed universal primers (U515F/806R) (15, 16) ﬂanked
by Illumina standard adapter sequences. Following ampliﬁcation,
products were pooled for sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq
platform and V2 chemistry with 2 × 250 bp paired-end reads.
Informatics
Assembly, annotation, and binning of DNA sequences were
performed at the University of Missouri Informatics Research
Core facility. Contiguous DNA sequences were assembled using
FLASH software (17) and removed if found to be short after
trimming for a base quality <31. Qiime v1.9.1 software (18)
was used to perform de novo and reference-based chimera
detection and removal, and remaining contiguous sequences
were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) via de novo
OTU clustering and a criterion of 97% nucleotide identity.
Taxonomy was determined for selected OTUs using BLAST
against the SILVA database (19, 20). Principal coordinate analyses
(PCoA) were performed using ¼ root-transformed OTU relative
abundance data in PAST 3.17 (21). Metrics of richness and αdiversity were determined based on a rareﬁed dataset subsampled
to a uniform read count of 2,289 reads per sample using
beta_diversity_through_plots.py, available at http://qiime.org/
scripts/beta_diversity_through_plots.html.
Statistical Analysis
Distribution of read counts in experimental and control samples
was ﬁrst tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk method, and
diﬀerences in read count were then determined using a MannWhitney rank sum test due to non-normality, implemented
in SigmaPlot 13.0. Diﬀerences in β-diversity between BALF
and OP swab communities were determined using one-way
permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA),
implemented in Past 3.18 (21). To evaluate the similarity between
OP and BALF bacterial communities in the context of SBP vs.
CAP, time-matched OP and BALF samples were collected from
a subset of patients (designated with a ∗in Table 2) and the
intra-subject similarities between the OP and BALF communities

Respiratory Dysbiosis in Canine Bacterial Pneumonia
in patients with SBP and CAP were visualized and tested for
signiﬁcance (between disease type) via principal coordinate
analysis (PCoA) and one-way PERMANOVA, respectively. In
both analyses (i.e., PCoA and PERMANOVA), comparisons were
performed using both unweighted (i.e., Jaccard) and weighted
(i.e., Bray-Curtis) metrics. Brieﬂy, the Jaccard similarity is based
on the agreement between two samples with regard to the
proportion of shared taxa while the Bray-Curtis similarity also
accounts for agreement between two samples with regard to the
relative abundance of shared taxa. In all cases, signiﬁcance was
established as p < 0.05.
RESULTS
Twenty BALF samples were collected from 15 diﬀerent dogs
that met the enrollment criteria, i.e., a diagnosis of bacterial
pneumonia based on clinical signs and associated with BALF
septic suppurative inﬂammation or a positive culture result.
Eighteen of those 20 samples had positive bacterial cultures, from
which ten of 18 (56%) yielded one bacterial isolate, and eight of
18 (44%) yielded between two and ﬁve isolates.
Sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicon libraries generated from
BALF and control ﬂuid ﬂushed through the bronchoscopes
resulted in signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p = 0.004) mean (± SEM) read
counts of 31,524 (± 7,663) and 4,728 (±1,576) reads per sample,
respectively. Additionally, seven BALF samples returning read
counts within two standard deviations of the mean read counts
generated from control samples showed generally good overall
agreement with culture results indicating that the data were still
meaningful. In contrast to the number of taxa identiﬁed based by
culture, the DNA detected in patient BALF samples represented
between 22 and 185 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs).
Thus, while traditional culture methods provide evidence of
live and cultivable bacteria in a sample and allow antimicrobial
susceptibility testing, 16S rRNA sequencing provides a more
comprehensive proﬁle of taxa present in a sample, whether
or not they are viable or cultivable. Additionally, mean ± SD
numbers of unique OTUs in BALF from dogs with CAP were
signiﬁcantly lower than those with SBP (26 ± 16 and 82 ± 30
OTUs, respectively; p = 0.0002).
In many cases, there was remarkable agreement between the
two methods, particularly in instances of a marked overgrowth
of a dominant taxon. Speciﬁcally, samples from dogs A and
D were both culture positive for Streptococcus canis alone, and
16S rRNA sequencing detected S. canis or Streptococcus sp. at
99.3 and 96.4% relative abundance (RA), respectively (Table 1).
Similarly, samples I1, I3, and M1 were culture positive for
Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Pseudomonas putida (I1),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans (I3),
and Klebsiella pneumoniae (M1), with 16S sequencing detecting
S. pseudintermedius (74.5% RA) and P. putida (1.5% RA),
P. aeruginosa (92.0% RA) and A. xylosoxidans (5.3% RA), and
Klebsiella sp. Z1 (34.8% RA), respectively in the same samples.
In the majority of the remaining samples, taxa detected
via culture were also detected via sequencing but not as the
dominant phylotype. In samples I2, M2, G1, G2, G3, H, J, L,
F, and N, the dominant taxon determined by sequencing was
not cultured despite many of the detected species being readily
cultivable. In the aforementioned group of samples, cultured
bacteria represented from <0.01 to 24.3% of the DNA detected
via 16S rRNA sequencing (median 2.55% RA) or, in four of the
eighteen culture-positive cases (22.2%), were not detected at all
in the sequencing data (i.e., Bordetella bronchiseptica in samples
F and H, Enterococcus spp. in sample G, and Ochrobacterium
anthropi in sample N).
In cases of SBP, we hypothesized that the same factors
predisposing the dog to pneumonia would facilitate greater
translocation of upper airway microbes to the lung, relative to
what occurs in CAP. PCoA analysis revealed complete separation
of BALF and OP samples in dogs with CAP, and substantial
overlap between BALF and OP samples in dogs with SBP
(Figure 1). Accordingly, PERMANOVA detected a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between samples sites when based on the Jaccard
similarity (p = 0.0003; F = 3.21), but not Bray-Curtis (p = 0.15;
F = 1.32), indicating that the BALF and OP communities diﬀer
based on the presence or absence of certain taxa, but not with
regard to the relative abundance of shared taxa. Factoring in
individual variability, the intra-subject similarity between BALF
and OP communities was low in the three cases of CAP from
whom OP samples were collected (i.e., dogs A–C), regardless of
the similarity index used (Figure 2). In contrast, samples from
severely dysphagic dogs with conﬁrmed aspiration pneumonia
(e.g., dogs G and M) evinced a high degree of compositional
similarity between BALF and OP microbiota (Figure 3). It is
worth noting that, despite the apparent dissimilarity between
BALF and OP swabs in samples from dogs diagnosed with
CAP, the dominant taxa detected in the lower airways were
consistently detected in the matched upper airway samples, albeit
at a much lower relative abundance. Relative abundance (RA) of
the dominant taxon is another metric used to describe resident
bacterial communities in CAP and SBP. In 4/6 dogs with CAP,
and in 1/9 dogs with SBP, there was near eradication of the
microbial diversity in the lower airways, with predominant OTUs
found in RAs between 92.4 and 99.9%.
DISCUSSION
Methods complementary to traditional laboratory-based culture
of BALF in dogs with bacterial pneumonia, such as 16S rRNA
sequencing, are useful to understand the complex relationship
between pathogen and resident microbes. In this study, cultures
of BALF, used by clinicians to provide insight into underlying
pathogens, identiﬁed between zero and ﬁve bacterial species
in dogs with bacterial pneumonia. This was in stark contrast
to DNA sequencing that revealed rich microbial communities
ranging from 22 to 185 distinct OTUs. Dysbiosis was appreciated
by increases in the relative abundance of speciﬁc taxa, and
interlinked with this change, a decrease in the predominating
taxa found in healthy dog lungs (6). In the majority of
BALF samples, the cultured bacteria were present in the
sequencing data, despite variation between dogs as to whether
the dominant taxa determined by culture was identical to

the dominant taxa based on sequencing. This phenomenon
has also been described in mechanically ventilated patients
in which 75% of organisms identiﬁed via culture were the
most abundant organisms identiﬁed via sequencing (22). An
advantage of molecular techniques is their enhanced ability
to provide insight as to how microbial communities change
in disease and allow comparisons in regional diﬀerences in
populations (i.e., upper vs. lower airways). Bacterial populations
present in the lungs during pneumonia depend on the
clinical scenario with diﬀerences between dogs with CAP
and SBP. In the former, there was generally a stark loss
of microbial diversity and replacement with a predominant
taxon. In the latter, with secondary risk factors for pneumonia,
such as laryngeal or esophageal dysfunction, lower airway
communities are likely heavily derived from those present in the
upper airways.

Respiratory Dysbiosis in Canine Bacterial Pneumonia
FIGURE 3 | Comparison of relative abundance in BALF and OP between community acquired and secondary bacterial pneumonia.
In a previous analysis of the lung microbiota of 16 healthy
dogs at the same institution (6), the most abundant taxa
were Acinetobacter johnsonii, Brevundimonas diminuta and
members for the family Pseudomonadaceae [mean (range) %
RA 19.81 (13.89–26.72), 22.48 (17.36–26.67), and 29.6 (18.57–
34.94), respectively]. The remainder of the taxa identiﬁed in
healthy dogs were present at a RA of 2.73% or less. This is in
stark contrast to the ﬁndings in this study, where Acinetobacter,
Brevundimonas, and members of the family Pseudomonadaceae
were present between 10 and 50% RA in 9/20 samples,
suggesting respiratory dysbiosis is a common component of
canine bacterial pneumonia.
In dogs with bacterial pneumonia, cultures of BALF would
seemingly support a single dominant or very small number
(<5) of lung pathogens; however, results of DNA sequencing
underscore the complexity of microbial communities in the lung,
even in the presence of infection. Mean numbers of distinct OTUs
identiﬁed in BALF of dogs with CAP (23) and SBP (82) were
similar to a prior study of the healthy canine lower respiratory
tract microbiome (6). Thus, richness (overall numbers of distinct
OTUs), while variable in pneumonia, was discordant with the
paucity of cultivable bacteria. Similarly, in a study evaluating
respiratory microbial communities of mechanically ventilated
patients with pneumonia, 12 out of 56 patients (21%) had
positive cultures. These patients had a signiﬁcant decrease in
microbial richness compared to culture negative subjects there
was a wide range in terms of richness (22). In patients that
developed pneumonia after receiving lung transplantation also
demonstrated a decrease in microbial richness (24). Most of the
microbes found via sequencing are not cultivable using standard
techniques, making it challenging to discern the larger picture of
microbial interactions within the lung. It is unclear how many
uncultured or as yet unidentiﬁed lung pathogens are responsible
for bacterial pneumonia, but study of the respiratory microbiome
will be critical moving forward.
The fact that, in 4 of 6 dogs with CAP, the predominant OTUs
represented between 92.4 and 99.9% of recovered DNA suggests
overgrowth of these organisms and reﬂect dramatic changes
from that reported in healthy dogs (6). It has been proposed
that disease is associated not just with pathogens gained, but
with resident species that are lost and that a greater risk of
repopulation with virulent organisms may be more likely with
disappearance of dominant species associated with health (25).
In dogs diagnosed with CAP, microbial diversity was abolished
relative to dogs with SBP.
With regard to those bacteria identiﬁed via standard culture
but not found in the sequencing data, Bordetella bronchiseptica
is a common and important canine respiratory pathogen
causing CAP that is also as a commensal organism in
healthy, asymptomatic dogs (23, 26). It is unclear as to why
B. bronchiseptica or closely related taxa were not detected in the
16S rRNA dataset. While the SILVA database used to annotate
the current data does contain multiple sequences speciﬁc to other
Bordetella spp., it is worth noting that the 16S rRNA sequence
of Achromobacter and Bordetella spp. share a high degree of
homology, and A. xylosoxidans was sequenced in both samples.
It is also possible that the Enterococcus and Bacillus species
identiﬁed via culture were a result of contamination, as these
organisms are considered to be ubiquitous. There are clinical
implications to identiﬁcation of organisms on culture that are
not present in the sample according to targeted sequencing. In
large part, results of standard culture techniques are relied upon
for information to guide treatment. This could potentially lead to
incorrect antibiotic selection.
Conversely, there are also limitations to the utility of
molecular approaches, the most apparent of which is the inability
to distinguish viable and dead bacteria using standard 16S rRNA
sequencing methods. The fact that many of the bacterial species
found in the sequencing data were also cultured indicates that at
least some of the bacteria present in the lungs are viable, and even
Frontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org

Vientós-Plotts et al.
Respiratory Dysbiosis in Canine Bacterial Pneumonia
if DNA detected in BALF represents bacteria that have been killed
by the immune defenses of the lung (e.g., pulmonary alveolar
macrophages), it does not obviate an inﬂuence of those bacteria
on airway health. Without a viable isolate, it is also not possible
to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing on taxa identiﬁed
via sequencing. Moreover, whether applying traditional culturebased or culture-independent molecular techniques, there is
an inherent risk of contamination and identiﬁcation of false
positives. However, while a single CFU can theoretically be
detected on culture, the competitive nature of 16S rRNA
sequencing (i.e., an overabundance of DNA amidst a limited
number of binding substrates on the sequencer ﬂow cell) renders
single CFUs as background noise and inadvertent contaminants
will not be detected as dominant taxa in the data. Lastly,
clinicians are limited by our still nascent appreciation of these
microbial communities. Until there is a better understanding
of the lung microbiota in the context of both health and
disease, it will be challenging to incorporate sequencing data into
clinical decisions.
The
development
of
targeted
sequencing
techniques
highlights limitations associated with standard culture. The
belief that the lower airways are sterile is still perpetuated in
textbooks; however, the notion of lung sterility has been refuted
by a number of studies following the ﬁrst culture-independent
report of the healthy human lung microbiome (27). Healthy
dogs and other species have diverse and dynamically changing
microbial communities inhabiting speciﬁc ecologic niches
in the lower airways in the absence of clinical evidence of
infection (6, 28–31). The composition of the lung microbiome
depends on microbial immigration into the airways, microbial
elimination and the relative reproduction rates of host microbial
communities determined by regional growth conditions (32).
Immigration is inﬂuenced by local mucosal extension from the
upper airways that lack a physical barrier separating them from
the lower airways, microaspiration, and inhalation of bacteria
from ambient air (8, 33). Protective reﬂexes, such as cough,
mucociliary function, and innate and adaptive mucosal immune
responses aﬀect elimination (8). Although bacterial pneumonia
has been regarded as resulting from invasion and growth of a
pathogen in the lungs, recent work suggests a primary driver of
disease is disruption of homeostasis of the complex microbial
ecosystem (34). The upper respiratory tract has been called
the gatekeeper to respiratory health, wherein “colonization
resistance” is provided by local bacterial communities preventing
establishment of mucosal infections capable of spreading to
the lower respiratory tract. Thus, while the airway microbiome
has the capacity to blunt growth of pathogenic species during
states of equilibrium, dysbiosis of upper airways in humans has
been linked to CAP (35), SBP (36), and ventilator associated
pneumonia (22). In the subset of dogs with paired OP and
BALF samples, 3 dogs had CAP, and 8 had SBP. The dogs with
CAP were more likely to have a single OTU predominate. In
contrast, dogs with SBP were more likely to have ≥2 OTUs. It is
interesting to note that in several cases (G3, M1, M2), one of the
OTUs found in BALF at a relative abundance of >10% was also
present in the OP at an even greater relative abundance. Taking
into consideration an underlying process disrupting homeostasis
in SBP, it was not surprising that dogs with SBP had more similar
microbial compositions of the upper and lower airways (i.e.,
more evident regional continuity) and greater diversity than
dogs with CAP.
While traditional culture methods provide evidence of live
and cultivable bacteria in a sample and allow antimicrobial
susceptibility testing, 16S rRNA sequencing provides a more
comprehensive proﬁle of taxa present in a sample, whether
or not they are viable or cultivable. Additionally, these data
highlight that just as lack of growth does not imply a sterile
environment, identiﬁcation of a particular organism with either
approach does not imply that this organism is the causative
agent of disease (37). Lack of growth could also be related to
the presence of fastidious organisms, such as Mycobacterium
that require speciﬁc media or growth conditions using standard
methods as it has been documented in people with pneumonia
(38) Bacterial culture with sensitivity testing guides treatment of
clinical infections and thus will still play a key role in therapy of
bacterial pneumonia. However, culture-independent techniques
may provide greater depth of understanding of the changes
in microbial composition that occur in bacterial pneumonia.
These methods could allow for identiﬁcation of pathogens that
may not be readily cultivable, help discriminate true pathogens
from colonizing bacteria (37) and provide insight into potential
treatment strategies that restore balance toward a microbial
population associated with health.
CONCLUSIONS
In
comparing
standard
culture
and
targeted
sequencing
techniques to identify organisms found in BALF of dogs
with bacterial pneumonia, we demonstrated discrepancies
between these techniques in terms of presence or absence of
predominating taxa and numbers of unique bacteria. Dysbiosis
of the respiratory microbiome is a key feature of canine
pneumonia, with decreased relative abundance of bacterial
community members found in health. Additionally, there
appears to be greater regional continuity between the upper and
lower airways in dogs with SBP. While much more commonly
observed in dogs with CAP than SBP, obliteration of microbial
diversity with evidence of overgrowth of one organism was noted
in one-third of the dogs in this study. This may suggest that
loss of dominant species associated with health could underlie
disease pathology. Clinical application of DNA sequencing may
be employed if culture is negative in dogs with compatible
clinical signs and septic suppurative BALF cytology, or if targeted
antimicrobial therapy against the cultivable bacteria fails to
produce disease resolution. Future studies aimed at restoring
a dysbiotic airway microbiome in canine bacterial pneumonia
are warranted.

Background: Few studies have investigated which patients with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) do not recover through regular cognitive behavior therapy or
pharmacotherapy and subsequently end up in intensive treatment like day treatment
or inpatient treatment. Knowing the predictors of intensive treatment in these patients
is signiﬁcant because it could prevent intensive treatment. This study has identiﬁed
predictors of intensive treatment in patients with OCD.
Methods:
Using 6-year longitudinal data of the Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder Association (NOCDA), potential predictors of intensive treatment were assessed
in patients with OCD (n = 419). Intensive treatment was assessed using the Treatment
Inventory Costs in Patients with Psychiatric Disorders (TIC-P). Examined potential
predictors were: sociodemographics, and clinical and psychosocial characteristics.
Logistic Generalized Estimating Equations was used to estimate to what extent the
various characteristics (at baseline, 2- and 4-year assessment) predicted intensive
treatment in the following 2 years, averaged over the three assessment periods.
Results:
Being single, more severe comorbid depression, use of psychotropic
medication, and a low quality of life predicted intensive treatment in the following 2 years.
Conclusions: Therapists should be aware that patients with OCD who are single, who
have more severe comorbid depression, who use psychotropic medication, and who
have a low quality of life or a drop in quality of life are at risk for intensive treatment.
Intensive treatment might be prevented by focusing regular treatment not only on OCD
symptoms but also on comorbid depression and on quality of life. Intensive treatment
might be improved by providing extra support in treatment or by adjusting treatment to
impairments due to comorbid depressive symptoms or a low quality of life.

Predictors Intensive Treatment OCD
INTRODUCTION
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing disorder,
often with a chronic course (1). There are evidence-based
treatments for OCD, namely cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)
and psychotropic medication, that can be oﬀered in more or less
intensive formats (2). Multidisciplinary guidelines recommend
determining the designated intensity of treatment according to
the principles of so-called “stepped care” (3–5). In line with
stepped care, the least intensive treatment possible is delivered
to patients ﬁrst, taking into account the nature and course of
their symptoms. In the case of non-response, treatment may be
“stepped up” to a more intensive level in an eﬀort to meet the
treatment goals (6). In the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guideline, the ﬁrst step in the treatment of
OCD consists of awareness, recognition and assessment (3). Next
step strategies comprise of CBT, antidepressant medication, or
a combination of these. In the case of non-response, treatment
is stepped up to treatment by a multidisciplinary team with
expertise in the management of OCD. Intensive treatment such
as day treatment or inpatient treatment may be considered in
this latter step for the most severe, impaired, and treatmentresistant patients. In the Netherlands, intensive treatment usually
consists of multimodal treatment, with CBT being the main
therapy, oﬀered in a group with other patients with anxiety
disorders and OCD. It can be oﬀered in a day-care setting or
in an inpatient setting. Intensive treatment usually takes several
(parts of) days a week up to 5 days a week for a few months
to 1 year. Admission may also be necessary when patients are
in crisis.
Up till now, no longitudinal studies into the predicting factors
of intensive treatment in OCD have been published. However,
cross-sectional research exists, describing the characteristics of
patients with OCD in intensive residential treatment. These
patients were treatment-resistant to antidepressants and/or
CBT, suﬀered from severe OCD symptoms and psychiatric
comorbidity (7–9), had an early age of onset of OCD and a long
duration of the disorder (10, 11), often did not have a partner or
a job (10–12) and had a low quality of life, with scores of one to
two standard deviations below the general population (13–17).
In populations with other mental disorders, more is known
about predictors of hospitalization. A systematic review of 58
papers on predictors of readmission in patients with several
mental disorders indicates that previous hospitalization, younger
age, being unmarried, having lower ﬁnancial means, not being
satisﬁed with the index treatment, having more hospital days on
the index admission, and a negative attitude toward medication
were predicting factors for psychiatric readmission (18). In
addition, being male, having psychotic symptoms, a longer
duration of untreated psychosis, less social satisfaction, disturbed
family dynamics, residing in an urban area, and illegal drugs
misuse were found predictive of hospitalization in recent
prospective cohort studies involving several mental disorders
(18–22). A population study combined several survey and
register databases of 2,638 individuals born in 1953, including
interviews with their mothers. From this study it appeared that
poor family relations in adolescence were associated with an
increased risk of inpatient psychiatric treatment in the years 1969
until 2008 (20).
Knowledge of characteristics that predict future intensive
treatment might help to optimize ﬁrst steps of treatment for
patients with OCD to prevent the need for intensive treatment.
This is signiﬁcant because intensive treatment may contribute
to stigmatization and the disruption of the lives of patients
by hindering work, education, care for children, hobbies or
social contacts (23, 24). In addition, intensive treatment is
expensive, which burdens society with costs. Nevertheless,
intensive treatment is still the best available treatment for
the most severe and impaired patients with OCD. Another
signiﬁcance of predictors of intensive treatment is that they might
be used to improve intensive treatment by tailoring it to the
characteristics of the patients who need it.
The goal of the present study was to identify predictors
of starting with intensive treatment. In the rest of the text,
we will refer to this as “predictors of intensive treatment,” for
reasons of readability. We have selected potential predictors
based on the above presented research ﬁndings in other
populations. In addition, potential predictors were selected
that have been associated with course and severity of OCD,
leading to the following potential predictors: sociodemographic
variables, clinical variables, and psychosocial variables including
personality traits (25, 26), the quality of the social network
(27), and childhood trauma (28–30). We hypothesized that
being male, being younger, having more severe symptoms, poor
insight in OCD, childhood trauma and a lower quality of social
relationships are predictors of intensive treatment.
METHODS
The
reporting
of
this
study
conforms
to
the
STROBE
statement (www.strobe-statement.org).
Procedure
Data were derived from the Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder Association (NOCDA) study, longitudinal cohort study
investigating the naturalistic long-term course of OCD in
patients referred to mental health care centers. The NOCDA
study design and baseline characteristics of the study sample
are described in detail elsewhere (31). The NOCDA study
was accredited by the Medical Ethical Committee of the VUUniversity Medical Center in 2005.
After their clinical assessment at one of the contributing
mental health clinics, 687 patients aged 18 years and over with
a lifetime diagnosis of OCD, as determined by the administration
of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders
(SCID-I) (32), were asked to participate in the NOCDA study.
Since NOCDA aims to follow a large representative sample of
OCD subjects in diﬀerent stages of the disease and with diﬀerent
degrees of illness severity, the only exclusion criterion was an
inadequate understanding of the Dutch language for the purposes
of the completion of interviews and self-report questionnaires.
Comprehensive measurements were done at baseline and after 2,
4, and 6 years.

Predictors Intensive Treatment OCD
Of the 687 patients who were asked to participate in the
NOCDA study, 419 (60.9%) gave written informed consent and
were enrolled in the study. A comparison on basic demographic
characteristics between patients that did (n = 419) and did not (n
= 268) agree to participate yielded no signiﬁcant diﬀerences.
Baseline measurements took place between 2005 and 2009
and included validated semi-structured interviews and selfreport questionnaires to gather information on a broad range
of variables related to OCD, comorbidity, and psychosocial
consequences. The baseline assessment took about 5 h. All
included participants were contacted after 2, 4, and 6 years for
assessment, irrespective of their treatment status. The follow-up
assessments took about 3 h and in most cases (80%) they were
performed by the same research assistant. During the follow-up
period, participants received treatment as usual. Three hundred
and eleven patients participated in the 2-year assessment (total
dropout 26%), 295 patients in the 4-year assessment (total
dropout 30%), and 272 patients in the 6-year assessment (total
dropout 35%).
Primary Outcome Measure: TIC-P
Treatment intensity was derived from the Treatment Inventory
of Costs in Patients with mental disorders (TIC-P) (33). This
is a 15-item interview assessing health care consumption in the
previous 6 months (at baseline) or since the previous interview
(at 2-, 4-, and 6-year). Treatment was scored as “intensive” when
patients responded on the TIC-P interview (33) by stating that
they were receiving day-care treatment or inpatient treatment in
a psychiatric hospital or a specialized OCD clinic. In all other
cases, treatment was scored as “not intensive.”
Potential Predictors of Intensive Treatment
in Patients With OCD
We
studied
three
categories
of
potential
predictors:
sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics.
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Age (in years), gender, having a partner (yes, no), having children
(yes, no), independent living situation [yes (living alone, with
partner or children), no (living in a mental health institution or
with parents)], education (number of years), paid employment
(yes, no), and income (16 categories of increasing income).
Clinical Characteristics
Severity of OCD was assessed using the Yale Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale for Severity (Y-BOCS) (34, 35). Age of onset
of OCD was assessed using the SCID-I as the earliest age
at which patients fulﬁlled the criteria for OCD. In order to
assess the number of current comorbid mental disorders, the
ascertained diagnoses on the SCID-I were counted (anxiety, mood-, post-traumatic stress-, eating-, somatoform-, and
substance-related disorders, and psychotic disorders). Presence
and severity of comorbid anxiety symptoms were assessed
using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (36), while comorbid
depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI) (37–39). Psychotropic medication was assessed
using the TIC-P (33), measuring use of all types of psychotropic
medication in the previous 6 months (at baseline and follow-up).
Insight in OCD was measured using the Overvalued Ideas Scale
(OVIS) (40).
Psychosocial Characteristics
Childhood trauma was assessed using the Structured Trauma
Interview (STI) (41). Traumas on the STI are: (1) early separation
from parent; (2) and (3) parental dysfunction of mother or father
respectively; (4) witnessing of interparental violence; (5) physical
abuse; (6) sexual abuse. Ascertained childhood traumas were
summed. Personality characteristics according to the Big Five
were assessed using the Five-Factor Personality Inventory (FFPI)
(42). Subscales of the FFPI are: extraversion, agreeableness,
conscientiousness, emotional stability, and autonomy. Social
support was assessed using the Social Support Inventory (43).
The self-rated EuroQol ﬁve dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D)
was used to assess quality of life (44). The EQ-5D contains ﬁve
dimensions signiﬁcant for quality of life: mobility, selfcare, daily
activities, pain/discomfort, and depression/anxiety.
Stable characteristics like age, gender, age of onset OCD,
childhood trauma, and personality characteristics were assessed
at baseline only. Characteristics that could vary over time
were assessed at baseline, 2- and 4-year assessment. These
characteristics were: relationship status, children, living situation,
education, employment, severity of OCD, number of current
comorbid mental disorders, comorbid anxiety and depressive
symptoms, use of psychotropic medication, social support, and
quality of life. An exception is the characteristic insight in OCD,
which was assessed at 2- and 4-year assessment.
Quality Aspects of NOCDA
The NOCDA study was coordinated by the Department of
Psychiatry at the Amsterdam UMC/GGZ inGeest, Amsterdam,
and included seven sites that were specialized OCD mental
health clinics spread over the Netherlands. All research assistants
had extensive experience in assessing OCD. In addition, they
received a 2-day course, and regular follow-up 1-day training
sessions in which videos of the SCID were rated, assessor rating
scales were practiced, and questions and problems raised by
the research assistants were able to be addressed. The ﬁrst
two interviews of all research assistants were audiotaped and
monitored by the ﬁeldwork coordinator in order to address any
misunderstandings or errors in performing the measurements.
All subsequent interviews were audiotaped for future reference.
The audiotapes were continuously randomly monitored in
about 10% of all taped interviews, as well as on the basis of
questions raised by the research assistants and the ﬁeldwork
coordinator. Assessments were done by around 30 research
assistants (profession: psychologist or experienced research
nursing staﬀ).
Statistical Analyses
Logistic Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with an
exchangeable correlation structure was used to estimate to
what extent the various characteristics (at baseline, 2- and 4year assessment) predicted intensive treatment in the following

period of 2 years, averaged over the three assessment periods
(see Figure 1).
The following GEE analyses were performed: (1) univariable
analyses in which all potential predictors were analyzed
separately;
(2)
multivariable
analyses
within
the
three
categories of potential predictors in which all variables of a
category showing statistical signiﬁcance in the univariable
analyses were analyzed together; and (3) a multivariable
analysis over the three categories including all variables
showing statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.05) in the multivariable
analyses within the three categories of potential predictors.
A backward selection strategy was used to obtain the ﬁnal
multivariable models.
As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analyses but corrected
for Y-BOCS severity. Insight in OCD will be analyzed separately
using the other characteristics because it was assessed at 2- and
4-year assessment only.
RESULTS
Description of Potential Predictors of
Intensive Treatment
Table 1 presents the description of the potential predictors at
baseline, 2- and 4-year measurement that may predict whether
patients will receive intensive treatment in the following 2
years. The mean severity of OCD and comorbid symptoms
decreased from baseline to 2-year measurement. From 2- to 4year measurement, these severity scores stabilized or increased
slightly.
Description of 6-Year Course of Intensive
Treatment
Table 2 presents the description of the intensive treatment
variable over the course of 6 years. Over time, fewer patients were
treated in mental health care (outpatient care as well as intensive
treatment).
GEE Regression Analyses: Potential
Predictors of Intensive Treatment
Table 3 presents the results of the analyses of the potential
predictors of intensive treatment 2 years later over a time period
of 6 years.
In the univariable analyses, not having a partner, a dependent
living situation, fewer years of education, not having a paid
job, more severe OCD, more current comorbid diagnoses, more
severe comorbid anxiety and depression, use of psychotropic
medication, less extraversion, less autonomy, less social support,
and a lower quality of life all signiﬁcantly predicted intensive
treatment 2 years later.
In the multivariable analysis of the sociodemographic
variables, not having a partner and not having a paid job
signiﬁcantly
predicted
intensive
treatment
2
years
later.
Predictors
in
the
multivariable
analysis
of
the
clinical
variables were more severe comorbid depression and use of
psychotropic medication, while in the multivariable analysis
of the psychosocial variables a lower quality of life predicted
intensive treatment 2 years later.
For the ﬁnal multivariable model, in which all signiﬁcant
predictors
from
the
previous
multivariable
models
were
analyzed
together,
severity
of
comorbid
depression
and
quality of life could not be included together due to high
collinearity. Because severity of comorbid depression had
a
stronger
association
with
intensive
treatment,
a
ﬁnal
multivariable model was made with this variable and quality
of life was not included (Table 3 model 1). In this model,
not having a partner, more severe comorbid depression
and use of psychotropic medication signiﬁcantly predicted
intensive treatment 2 years later. When quality of life was
substituted for severity of comorbid depression in the ﬁnal
multivariable model (Table 3 model 2), it appeared that a
lower quality of life signiﬁcantly predicted intensive treatment
2 years later as well as not having a partner and use of
psychotropic medication.

From the sensitivity analysis, in which we repeated the
analyses but corrected for Y-BOCS severity, it appeared that the
same predictors were signiﬁcantly related to intensive treatment
in the ﬁnal multivariable analysis. Thus, these factors predict
intensive treatment independently of OCD severity.
Insight in OCD was not signiﬁcantly related to intensive
treatment [OR = 1.07, 95% CI (0.98, 1.18); p = 0.14].
DISCUSSION
We studied potential predictors of intensive treatment in the
subsequent 2 years in patients with OCD over the course of
6 years. It appeared that patients with OCD who were single,
who had more severe comorbid depressive symptoms, who used
psychotropic medication, and who had a low quality of life were
signiﬁcantly more likely to have intensive treatment 2 years later.
Our results on being single and more severe comorbid depression
resemble the results concerning other mental disorders (18,
19, 21). Thus, also in patients with OCD, these variables
predict future intensive treatment. Quality of life as a potential
predictor of intensive treatment has not been studied before.
Our result that psychotropic medication predicts future intensive
treatment is not congruent with previous research results in
which a negative attitude toward medication—and thus likely not

using medication—predicted admission (18, 22). This diﬀerence
might reﬂect the diﬀerent study populations. While in patients
with psychotic disorders or mood disorders medication has
a large eﬀect on symptoms and prevents relapse, crisis, and
hospitalization (45, 46), in OCD, medication has only a moderate
eﬀect. SSRIs cause a mean reduction of 3.2 points on the Y-BOCS,
over placebo, in patients with OCD according to a meta-analysis
including 17 studies (3,097 participants) (47). Therefore, patients
with OCD not taking medication usually does not lead to severe
relapse or crisis, or an increase in the risk of hospitalization. A
second explanation for our ﬁnding might be that stepped-care
principles were followed in the treatment of OCD that indicate
prescription of psychotropic medication before stepping up to
more intensive treatments (3).
Contradictory to our hypotheses, the following potential
predictors did not signiﬁcantly predict intensive treatment.
Remarkably, although severity of OCD was associated with
intensive treatment in the univariable analysis of our study, this
association disappeared in the multivariable models, indicating
that other variables were more important in predicting intensive
treatment. This might indicate that despair and limitations as
a result of OCD are more important reasons for intensive
treatment than severity of OCD per se. Next, insight in OCD
did not predict intensive treatment in our study. This is not
congruent with a previous ﬁnding in patients with several mental
disorders that better insight was predictive of readmission (48).
Also, it is not in line with previous ﬁndings that patients with
poor insight in OCD were less likely to seek mental health
care (49). In addition, poor insight in OCD was previously
related to severity and chronicity of OCD (50–52). Possibly,
eﬀects of insight and help-seeking on intensive treatment cancel
each other out. More speciﬁcally, patients with poor insight
are often severe and chronic patients for whom intensive
treatment is indicated. However, they are less likely to seek
help. Conversely, patients with good insight do seek help but
need intensive treatment less often. Lastly, childhood trauma
was not predictive of intensive treatment in our study. To our
knowledge, childhood trauma has not been studied as a potential
predictor for intensive treatment before. Contradictory results
have been found on the association between childhood trauma
and severity and chronicity of OCD (28–30, 53). While childhood
trauma is an important predictor of severity and chronicity of
depression in patients with depressive disorders, the relationship
between childhood trauma and severity and chronicity of OCD is
less clear (54).
The predictors of intensive treatment that have emerged
from our study might be used to tailor intensive treatment
to the characteristics of the patients involved. For instance,
single patients obviously lack the support from a partner,
which might make it harder for them to stay motivated in
the face of setbacks in treatment. Therapists may need to
organize or oﬀer extra support to pull these patients through.
Next, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms or with a
low quality of life may have diﬃculty following an intensive
treatment program. In that case, adapting the treatment to
the impairment of the patient may be helpful, and could be
done by including activation in treatment or by shortening
treatment days.
Our results indicate that intensive treatment might be
prevented by improving comorbid depression and quality of
life in ﬁrst-step treatments in addition to treating OCD. In
other words, to not focus only on diminishing OCD symptoms
in treatment but also on vitality and promoting a fulﬁlling
life with elements that patients want from life, like work,
pleasurable activities, a partner, and a social network. We
recommend therapists to encourage patients to fulﬁll life’s
wishes while allowing them to be hindered by OCD as
little as possible. In our clinical experience, patients tend to
postpone fulﬁlling their life’s wishes based on the idea that it
is better to wait until the OCD symptoms have disappeared.
However, this conviction contributes to the notion of being
disabled, which drives patients further away from their goals
in life and in treatment. Therefore, therapists should educate
patients about the importance of working on their life’s goals
in treatment in addition to working on OCD. Furthermore,
therapists can help to ﬁnd practical solutions to obstacles that
may arise.
During the last decade, it has been accepted that recovery from
mental disorders does not just entail having fewer symptoms
but also regaining functioning and resuming a meaningful life
(55). Guidelines like the NICE and the APA guidelines recognize
the importance of focusing on functioning and quality of life in
treatment (3, 4). Also, treatments are increasingly being evaluated
using quality of life outcome measures (56–58). Moreover,
recovery-oriented treatment programs have been implemented
for patients with severe mental illness like schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, major depressive disorder, borderline personality
disorder, and substance use disorders. These treatment programs
foster adapting to chronic mental illness and movement toward
personally meaningful goals like work and education (59–61).
Recovery-oriented treatment programs help to improve both

these patients with severe mental illness (59). Another treatment
that can be eﬀective in improving quality of life is acceptance
and commitment therapy (ACT), which aims to accept negative
feelings, while moving toward meaningful goals in accordance
with personal values (62–64).
A limitation of this study is that although we had a
longitudinal study design with potential predictors preceding the
outcome measure (intensive treatment) in time, we were unable
to establish causal connections between potential predictors
and intensive treatment. Future research should thus examine
whether treatment of the signiﬁcantly associated predictors
of our study indeed prevents intensive treatment. Another
limitation is the attrition rate of 35% over the course of 6
years. To investigate whether dropout was selective, we have
compared baseline characteristics of patients who participated
in the 6-year assessment with patients who did not participate.
Patients did not diﬀer on any of the baseline characteristics
except that patients who dropped out had less years of
education (mean = 11.7; SD = 3.3) compared to patients who
participated in the 6-year assessment [mean = 13.1; SD = 3.2;
t(416) = −4.2, p < 0.01]. In previous studies, education was
a determinant of attrition as well (65, 66). Presumably, our
results were not biased by selective attrition. Last limitation
is a potential historical eﬀect due to the fact that the data
was collected between 2005 and 2015. However, the intensive

treatments that were common in the Netherlands during the
NOCDA data collection have largely remained the same to
date. This study also had a strength: we had access to a
large, representative sample of treatment-seeking patients with
OCD who were followed for a long period of time. Thus, our
results are generalizable to clinically referred OCD patients in a
specialized setting.
In conclusion, therapists should be aware that patients
with OCD who are single, who have more severe comorbid
depression, who use psychotropic medication, and who have
a low quality of life or a drop in quality of life are at risk
for intensive treatment. This is signiﬁcant because knowledge
of these predictors might help to optimize ﬁrst-step treatments
for patients with OCD to prevent the necessity of intensive
treatment. In addition, the signiﬁcant predictors of our study
might be used to tailor intensive treatment to the characteristics
of patients involved. We advise working on comorbid depression
and personal goals in treatment in addition to working on
OCD. Also, we advise providing extra support in treatment for
patients who need it and to adjust treatment to impairments
due to comorbid depressive symptoms or a low quality
of life.

Epithelial cells are an important line of defense within the lung. Disruption of the epithelial
barrier by pathogens enables the systemic dissemination of bacteria or viruses within the host
leading to severe diseases with fatal outcomes. Thus, the lung epithelium can be damaged by
seasonal and pandemic inﬂuenza A viruses. Inﬂuenza A virus infection induced dysregulation
of the immune system is beneﬁcial for the dissemination of bacteria to the lower respiratory
tract, causing bacterial and viral co-infection. Host cells regulate protein homeostasis and the
response to different perturbances, for instance provoked by infections, by post translational
modiﬁcation of proteins. Aside from protein phosphorylation, ubiquitination of proteins is an
essential regulatory tool in virtually every cellular process such as protein homeostasis, host
immune response, cell morphology, and in clearing of cytosolic pathogens. Here, we analyzed
the proteome and ubiquitinome of A549 alveolar lung epithelial cells in response to infection by
either Streptococcus pneumoniae D39Dcps or inﬂuenza A virus H1N1 as well as bacterial and
viral co-infection. Pneumococcal infection induced alterations in the ubiquitination of proteins
involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPases, but had minor effects
on the abundance of host proteins. H1N1 infection results in an anti-viral state of A549 cells.
Finally, co-infection resembled the imprints of both infecting pathogens with a minor increase
in the observed alterations in protein and ubiquitination abundance.

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory tract infections are among the most prevalent causes of death worldwide (Roth et al.,
2018). These infections are mainly caused by inﬂuenza A virus (IAV), Streptococcus pneumoniae
and other pathogens (Aliberti and Kaye, 2013; Troeger et al., 2019). Infections with IAV can cause
dissemination of bacteria to the lower respiratory tract allowing viral and bacterial co-infection
(Ruuskanen and Järvinen, 2014; Self et al., 2017). Thus, viral and bacterial co-infection is related to

increased mortality compared to single infections (Palacios et al.,
2009; Hammerschmidt, 2016; Cawcutt and Kalil, 2017).
Recently, it has been shown that co-infection occurs in
seasonal and pandemic IAV infection in more than 30% of all
cases (Brundage, 2006; Morens et al., 2008). The Gram-positive
bacterium S. pneumoniae is mainly associated as secondary
infection in IAV infected patients (Palacios et al., 2009).
Inﬂuenza A virus infection can cause disruption of the
epithelial barrier and impaired immune response causing
bacterial spreading and reduced bacterial killing (Siemens
et al., 2017). In the lung, epithelial cells act as an important
line of defense and are involved in pathogen sensing and
initiation of the host immune response (Vareille et al., 2011;
Hiemstra et al., 2015). Among others, posttranslational
modiﬁcations of proteins, like protein phosphorylation and
ubiquitination, regulate processes within the host cell. Proteins
can be modiﬁed with various types of ubiquitination like
monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination. Ubiquitin, a
protein of 76 amino acids, is covalently linked to the e-amine
group of lysine residues in target proteins and thus, regulates
their stability, localization or interaction properties. The function
of ubiquitination depends on the length and linkage type of the
ubiquitin chain. Furthermore, ubiquitin is involved in the
regulation of immunity and clearance of intracellular
pathogens (Bhat and Greer, 2011; Zinngrebe et al., 2014; Hu
and Sun, 2016). It was demonstrated previously that bacterial
and viral pathogens are able to manipulate the ubiquitin
proteasome system (UPS) to evade the host defense. Moreover,
host ubiquitin is misused by inﬂuenza A viruses to facilitate
particle uncoating and transport within the host cell (Rudnicka
and Yamauchi, 2016; Yamauchi, 2020). Here, we infected type 2
lung epithelial cells (A549) with a pandemic IAV, with S.
pneumoniae D39Dcps, and conducted viral and bacterial coinfection to elaborate the effects of these infections on protein
abundance and on protein ubiquitination. We enriched for K48
and K63 polyubiquitinated proteins, because these ubiquitin
chains are the most dominant within the lung tissue, and
applied label free LC-MS/MS based quantiﬁcation. The results
of this study contribute to the understanding of the ubiquitin
mediated regulatory processes during viral and bacterial
co-infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial and Viral Strains
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39Dcps, a non-encapsulated mutant
of D39 was described earlier (Saleh et al., 2013).
The pandemic inﬂuenza A/H1N1 virus [A/Germany-BY/74/
2009(H1N1)] was kindly provided by the Institute of
Immunology (FLI, Federal Research Institute for Animal
Health) (Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany).
Cell Culture and Infections
A549 alveolar type 2 lung epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-185) were
cultured in T75 ﬂasks in RPMI medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C in 5%
CO2 atmosphere. For infection experiments, cells were seeded
into T75 ﬂasks and grown to 80-90% conﬂuence. 2 h before all
infections the medium of A549 cells was exchanged by RPMI
without FCS.
Bacteria were grown at 37°C in Todd Hewitt broth
supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY) to midexponential phase (OD600 of 0.35-0.40). Pneumococci were
washed and resuspended in PBS prior to infection. A549 cells
were infected with S. pneumoniae D39Dcps at a MOI of 15 and
were harvested 6 h post infection.
For viral infections, A549 cells were infected at a MOI of 5.
After 2 h the medium was replaced by RPMI supplemented with
10% FCS and cells were harvested 24 hours post infection. Viral
replication was conﬁrmed via qRT-PCR (Supplementary
Figure S1).
For co-infections, A549 cells were infected with IAV followed
by bacterial infection. Cells were infected with IAV at a MOI of 5.
After 2 h the medium was replaced by RPMI supplemented with
10% FCS and infected cells were cultured for additional 20 h at
37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Then, 2 h before bacterial infection,
media was changed to RPMI without FCS. Hereafter, A549 cells
were infected with S. pneumoniae D39Dcps (MOI 15) for 6 h.
At the end of the infection period cells were washed with PBS
and cells were detached using trypsin and counted. Cell counts
were determined by light microscopic quantiﬁcation of cell
viability. Cells were stained with 0.4% (v/v) trypan blue under
serum-free conditions and visually examined.
All experiments were performed in triplicates (n=3).
Interleukin ELISA
ELISA plates (Human IL-6/IL-8 Max Deluxe Set [BioLegend])
were coated with capture antibody and incubated for 16-18 h at
4°C. Plates were washed (PBS + 0.5% Tween-20). Hereafter,
plates were blocked with blocking solution for 1 h with shaking at
200 rpm. Furthermore, standard series were prepared (IL-8: 1000
pg/ml – 15.6 pg/ml, IL-6: 500 pg/ml – 7.8 pg/ml). Non-speciﬁc
bindings were blocked, blocking solution was removed and plates
were washed. Standards and cell culture medium samples were
added to the plates and incubated for 2 h with shaking. After the
plates were washed, they were incubated with the detection
antibody for 1 h. The detection antibody solution was removed
and plates were washed. Avidin-HRP solution was added and
incubated for 30 min with shaking. Avidin-HRP solution was
removed and plates were washed. TMB substrate solution was
added and incubated for 15 min in the dark. Stop solution (2 N
H2SO4) was added and absorbance was measured at 450 nm and
570 nm within 15 min.
Protein Extraction
Protein extraction was performed as described elsewhere (Sura
et al., 2021). Brieﬂy, harvested cells were resuspended in 1 ml
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.5], 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1% NP 40, 10% glycerol, 1x cOmplete Protease Inhibitor

centrifugation. Protein concentration of the samples was
determined by the BCA assay.
Selective Enrichment of K48 and K63
Ubiquitinated Proteins
Lysates containing 500 µg of total protein were transferred into
new tubes and ﬁlled to 300 µl with lysis buffer. To reduce
unspeciﬁc binding of proteins to magnetic beads, 10 µl of
magnetic control beads (LifeSensors) have been added to the
samples and were incubated in an overhead shaker for 1 h at 10
rpm and 4°C. Afterwards, supernatants were transferred into
new tubes. For the enrichment of K48 ubiquitinated proteins, 40
µl of K48 magnetic TUBE HF (LifeSensors), washed with Trisbuffered saline with Tween20 (TBS-T), were added, followed by
an incubation for 3 h at 10 rpm and 4°C. To enrich K63
polyubiquitinated proteins, 700 µl water and K63 Flag-TUBE
(LifeSensors) with a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM were added to
the precleared sample and incubated for 2 h at 10 rpm and 4°C.
Subsequently, 8 µl of magnetic anti-Flag beads were added and
samples were incubated for additional 2 h. The unbound fraction
of both enrichments was removed and the beads were washed
three times with 500 µl TBS-T. To elute the enriched proteins,
beads were resuspended in 25 µl SDS buffer (5% SDS; 50 mM
TEAB; 5 mM TCEP) and incubated at 65°C for 45 min with 300
rpm shaking. Finally, the supernatants were transferred into
new tubes.
Proteolytic Digest
Extracted and enriched ubiquitinated proteins were digested by
suspension trapping on micro S Traps (Protiﬁ) as described
elsewhere (Sura et al., 2021). Brieﬂy, lysates containing 30 µg
protein were transferred into new tubes and disulﬁde bonds were
reduced by adding TCEP. Thiol groups were alkylated by adding
iodoacetamide for proteome samples or chloroacetamide for
ubiquitinome samples. Proteins were digested by adding 25 µl
digestion buffer (50 mM TEAB) containing 1.2 µg trypsin for
proteome samples and 600 ng trypsin (Promega) for ubiquitin
enriched samples followed by an incubation for 3 h at 47°C.
Peptides were subsequently eluted with 40 µl 50 mM TEAB; 0.1%
acetic acid; 60% ACN in 0.1% acetic acid. All eluted fractions of a
sample were pooled and dried in a vacuum concentrator. Dried
peptides were stored at -80°C
Peptide Fractionation
Peptides generated from crude protein extracts were fractionated
by off-line high pH reversed phase chromatography as described
elsewhere (Sura et al., 2021).
LC-MS/MS Analysis
The peptide composition of the generated samples was analyzed
by LC-MS/MS with an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) coupled to a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). Peptides were loaded onto in-house packed
fused silica columns of 20 cm length and an inner diameter of 75
µm, ﬁlled with ReproSil Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 µm (Dr. Maisch).
Peptides were subsequently eluted by a non-linear binary
gradient of 165 min from 2% to 99% solvent B (0.1% acetic
acid in acetonitrile) in solvent A (0.1% acetic acid). Detailed
information on the gradient and LC setup can be found in
Supplementary Table S1. MS/MS data for the proteome and the
K48 ubiquitin chain enriched samples were acquired as
previously described (Sura et al., 2021). For the K63 ubiquitin
chain enriched samples the mass spectrometer was operated in
DDA mode. The survey scan was acquired from 300-1650 m/z
with a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m/z. The 10 most abundant
ions were selected for fragmentation via HCD with a normalized
collision energy of NCE 27. The AGC target was set to 1E5 with
an underﬁll ratio of 10% and a maximum injection time of 180
ms. MS/MS spectra were acquired in centroid mode with a
resolution of 17,500 at 200 m/z. Ions with unassigned charge
states as well as charge 1 and higher than 6 were excluded from
fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s and lock mass
correction was enabled. Detailed information on the MS/MS
acquisition parameters for all datasets are provided in
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.
Database Search
Datasets of enriched polyubiquitinated and total proteome
samples were processed separately. Raw data were searched
with MaxQuant (version 1.6.17.0) (Cox and Mann, 2008; Cox
et al., 2014) against the UniProt databases for human (July 2019,
UP000005640, 20,416 entries), Inﬂuenza A virus (A/GermanyBY/74/2009(H1N1)) (December 2017, UP000153067, 10 entries)
and for S. pneumoniae D39 (September 2020, UP000001452,
1,915 entries). The maximum number of allowed missed
cleavages was 2 and precursor mass tolerance was set to 4.5
ppm. Carbamidomethylation (C) was set as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation,
oxidation (M) and acetylation (protein N‐termini) were set as
variable modiﬁcations for both datasets. GlyGly (K) was set as an
additional variable modiﬁcation for K48 and K63 ubiquitin chain
enriched samples. Proteins were identiﬁed with at least two
unique peptides, and peptide-spectrum match (PSM) and
protein false discovery rate (FDR) were set to 0.01. Match
between runs was applied and protein abundances were
calculated by the MaxLFQ algorithm. A detailed table of
applied parameters for database searching can be found in
Supplementary Tables S4 and S5.
Data Analysis
Identiﬁed protein groups were analyzed with Perseus (version
1.6.15.0) (Tyanova et al., 2016; Tyanova and Cox, 2018). Only
identiﬁed by site and reverse hits, as well as potential
contaminations were removed. To assess differentially
expressed proteins, a two tailed t test was applied for proteins
with “LFQ intensity” values in three out of three replicates of the
compared groups. Proteins were considered as differentially
expressed with a p value < 0.05 and a fold change > 1.5.
Quantiﬁcation results and summary statistics can be found in
Supplementary Table S6. Functional annotation enrichment of
proteins with signiﬁcantly changed abundance was performed
with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery (DAVID v6.8) (Da Huang et al., 2009a; Da Huang
et al., 2009b) and Reactome (Jassal et al., 2020). Protein
interaction networks were created with STRING (v11.0)

Data variance was assessed by calculation of CVs from proteins
with quantitative values in all three replicates (Supplementary

RESULTS
To investigate the effect of bacterial or viral mono-infections and
bacto-viral co-infections we infected A549 cells at a MOI that
does not kill the majority of the A549 cells within the analyzed
time frame. Also, we aimed to explore, whether the co-infection
will be more severe to A549 cells than the infections with a single
pathogen. Therefore, we analyzed the proteome and
ubiquitinome of mono- and co-infected A549 cells.
Cell Count and Interleukin Secretion
A549 cells were grown to 80%-90% conﬂuence. Hereafter, cells
were challenged either with the inﬂuenza A virus H1N1, S.
pneumoniae D39Dcps, or both pathogens in a viral bacterial
co-infection. After 24 h of viral infection the A549 cell count
signiﬁcantly increased by more than 25% (Supplementary
Figure S3). This indicates that IAV propagation does not
interfere with A549 proliferation within the observed time
frame. In contrast, a 25% reduced cell count was observed after
6 h of S. pneumoniae infection. After co-infection the number of
cells did not change compared to the uninfected control.
Cell culture supernatants of each infection were used to
determine the levels of secreted immune modulating effectors.
The average (n=3) level of IL-6 and IL-8 was increased after S.
pneumoniae infection and bacto-viral co-infection
(Supplementary Figure S4), but not after single viral infection.
In detail, there is a difference in IL-6 and IL-8 levels when
comparing the bacterial single infection or the co-infection with
the corresponding mock infection. In contrast, there is no
difference between the single H1N1 infection and the
associated mock infection. Therefore, the H1N1 infection does
not lead to an increased interleukin production.
Differentially Abundant Proteins in
Proteome and Ubiquitinome
For all experiments, the PSM FDR and the protein FDR have
been set to 0.01. Proteins were considered as signiﬁcantly
changed in abundance, when they were quantiﬁed in all three
replicates of the compared groups with a fold change greater than
1.5 and a p-value below 0.05. This, in total, resulted in the
identiﬁcation of more than 90,000 peptides, enabling
quantiﬁcation of more than 5,800 proteins for the proteome
data set. In the proteome of A549 cells 74, 37 and 107 proteins
were found to be signiﬁcantly changed in abundance upon H1N1
infection, S. pneumoniae infection, and co-infection, respectively
(Figure 1A). H1N1 infection induced the accumulation
of various proteins, whereas the S. pneumoniae infection
mainly led to decreasing protein abundances. Moreover,
different sets of proteins were effected by viral or bacterial
infection. This is also reﬂected by the low overlap between
these infections (Figure 1B).
After enrichment of polyubiquitinated proteins we were able
to identify more than 34,000 and 9,800 peptides, from the K48
and K63 enriched samples, respectively. This enabled the
quantiﬁcation of more than 2,800 proteins after K48
enrichment and more than 850 proteins in the K63 enriched
data set (Figure 1A). In contrast to the proteome and K63
polyubiquitin enriched data sets, S. pneumoniae infection
induced more changes than H1N1 infection in the K48
polyubiquitin enriched data set. Comparison of the proteins,
which were differentially expressed upon viral and bacterial
infection, revealed only a limited number of shared proteins
between the single infections (Figures 1A, C, D). To elaborate
whether altered abundance detected for proteins in the
polyubiquitin enriched data sets originates from alterations in
protein abundance in general, we examined the overlap of
proteins that were detected with altered abundance in those
data sets (Supplementary Figure S5). Whereas upon
pneumococcal infection three proteins were detected with
differential expression in the proteome and K48 enriched
samples, 18 and 15 proteins were differentially expressed in the
proteome and K48 enriched data set upon viral and co-infection,
respectively (Supplementary Figure S5). This indicates that in
most cases altered abundance in polyubiquitin enriched samples
is independent of variations in the abundance of the respective
proteins. Hence, differential abundance in polyubiquitin
enriched data sets is caused by changing polyubiquitination
incidence rather than by changing protein abundance. Volcano
plots and MA plots, comparing the different conditions are
shown in Supplementary Figures S6–S8.
Functional Analysis of Proteins
Differentially Expressed in the Total
Proteome Samples
To get detailed insights into the processes driving the cellular
response to the infecting pathogens, we used the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to
perform annotation enrichment on proteins with signiﬁcantly
changed abundance.
Infecting A549 cells with H1N1 signiﬁcantly altered the
abundance of 74 proteins within the proteome samples. The
abundance of 63 proteins was increased and decreased for eleven
proteins. Functional annotation enrichment revealed that type I
interferon, ISG and other terms, which represent a response to
viruses, were mainly enriched within proteins of increased
abundance (Figure 2A). No terms have been enriched from
proteins with reduced abundance (Figure 2A).
In the proteome of S. pneumoniae infected A549 cells only 37
proteins were detected with signiﬁcantly altered abundance,
among them we detected ten with increased abundance and 27
with decreased abundance. Here, the terms oxidation-reduction
process (p-value = 0.00022) and regulation of translation (p-value =

0.0055) were enriched from proteins with reduced abundance. In
contrast to the H1N1 infection, no terms were enriched from proteins
with increased abundance.
Viral and bacterial co-infections of A549 cells mainly affected
Gene Ontology Biological Process-terms (GOBP-terms) similar to
those enriched in single infections. Proteins with increased
abundance were annotated for GOBP terms defense to virus, type I
interferon signaling pathway and ISG15-protein conjugation. The
term oxidation-reduction process was enriched from proteins with
decreased abundance (Figure 2B). In general, there is a reasonable
quantity of proteins detected with the same regulation between the
single infection and the co-infection (Figure 1B). Additionally,
several proteins were quantiﬁed in the H1N1 and co-infection, but
were missing in uninfected and S. pneumoniae infected samples.
These proteins are MX1, MX2, IFI44, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIH1,
which are all involved in type I interferon signaling and viral defense.
Furthermore, 17 proteins that are included in the integrated
annotations for Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin-like Conjugation
Database (iUUCD 2.0) (Zhou et al., 2018) and 2 proteins that are
catalytically active subunits of the immunoproteasome as well as
the proteasome activator subunit beta (PA28beta) were detected
with altered protein abundance upon infection (Table 1).
Functional Analysis of Differentially
Abundant Proteins in K48 Enriched
Samples
As ubiquitination is involved in the regulation of nearly every
cellular process, we selectively enriched for K48 and K63
polyubiquitinated proteins. It was demonstrated that K48 and
K63 polyubiquitin chains are the most abundant chain types in
murine primary macrophages and in murine lung tissue (Heunis
et al., 2020). K48 ubiquitination has a variety of functions in the
eukaryotic cell. Still, the primary function is to mark proteins for
proteasomal degradation.
After 24 h of H1N1 infection, there were fewer changes in
protein abundance detected in K48 enriched samples compared
to total proteome samples. GOBP terms that were most
signiﬁcantly overrepresented from proteins with increased
abundance in the K48 enriched samples were defense response
to virus, type I interferon signaling pathway and negative

regulation of viral genome replication, while RNA splicing was
most signiﬁcantly overrepresented from proteins with
decreased abundance.
Upon S. pneumoniae infection we detected altered abundance
of 108 putatively K48 polyubiquitinated proteins. Fifty-nine
proteins were quantiﬁed with decreased abundance and 49
with increased abundance after infection. Only three out of 37
proteins detected with differential expression in the proteome
samples were detected with altered abundance in the K48
polyubiquitin enrichment. Proteins with decreased abundance
in K48 polyubiquitination mostly affected processes involved in
mRNA splicing and rRNA processing. Arp2/3 complex mediated
actin nucleation and other processes related to actin ﬁlament
organization were highly overrepresented by proteins with
increased K48 polyubiquitination. In addition to actin ﬁlament
related processes, FC-gamma receptor signaling pathway involved
in phagocytosis was enriched from proteins with increased K48
polyubiquitination, as well.
In the viral and bacterial co-infection the pattern of proteins
with signiﬁcantly changed abundance after K48 enrichment is
similar to both of the single infections. Moreover, the coinfection shares ~50% and ~15% of differentially expressed

proteins with the bacterial and the viral infection, respectively
(Figure 1C). Proteins that were shared between the single
infections change their abundance into the same direction.
Although the STRING network, which was generated from the
co-infection (Figure 3B) data, has a high similarity to the
network generated from the bacterial infection (Figure 3A), it
also contains a cluster of proteins that has been detected upon
viral infection (response to virus) (Figure 3B). Furthermore, eight
proteins were found to be changed signiﬁcantly in all infections
and three of them are related to RNA splicing (Figure 1C). Ten
proteins were only quantiﬁed in the viral and in co-infection
samples. These proteins affect the processes of response to virus,
type I interferon signaling pathway and interferon-gammamediated signaling pathway.
Functional Analysis of Differentially
Abundant Proteins in K63 Enriched
Samples
In contrast to K48 polyubiquitination, K63 polyubiquitin chains
are thought to mediate non-proteasomal signals for endocytosis
and immune responses. The K63 enriched data set displays the
lowest number of quantiﬁed proteins within the three data sets
obtained in this work. Accordingly, the K63 data set reveals fewer
proteins detected with altered abundance. H1N1 infection
induced variations in the K63 polyubiquitination level of 30
proteins. Proteins with reduced K63 ubiquitination affect
mRNA splicing processes and proteins with increased K63
ubiquitination affect redox processes. Changes induced by the S.
pneumoniae infection do not affect multiple pathways, only
negative regulation of mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization involved in apoptotic signaling pathway is
affected by proteins with increased K63 polyubiquitination. Coinfection most signiﬁcantly affected processes involved in mRNA
processing from proteins with decreased polyubiquitination.
Proteins with increased polyubiquitination affected redox
processes and response to ER stress.
DISCUSSION
In the work presented, we used in vitro cell culture based
infection experiments to examine potential synergistic effects of
the infecting pathogens in viral and bacterial co-infections on
human lung epithelial cells. Therefore, we analyzed viral and
bacterial mono-infections, along with bacto-viral co-infections of
A549 cells, focusing on the proteome, as well as the selective
enrichment of polyubiquitinated proteins. Infecting A549 cells
with H1N1 for 24 h induced a pronounced immune response
and viral defense of the host. The additional bacterial infection
was performed at MOI 15 to be able to elaborate a potential
synergisms of the pathogens.
Response to IAV H1N1 Infection
Inﬂuenza H1N1 infection induced a strong viral defense
response of the A549 cells. This was established by the
induction of the JAK-STAT cascade, type I interferon
signaling, interferon g signaling and induction of the ISG15
protein conjugation. Induction of the type I interferon
production mediated by RIG-I and MAVS, which leads to the
induction of a wide array of genes, can be assumed from
increased protein abundance of interferon stimulated genes
(Schoggins et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, we
detected a 25 fold increase in the abundance of DDX60 which
was shown to be required for RIG-I mediated type I interferon
expression after viral infection (Miyashita et al., 2011). From the
proteins with higher abundance after viral infection, nine show
E3 ligase activity and one protein is described as an E2 enzyme
(Zhou et al., 2018) (Table 1). Among these proteins are HERC5
and TRIM25, both acting as E3 ligating enzymes for ISG15

(Wong et al., 2006; Mathieu et al., 2021), which increased twelve
and ﬁve times in abundance in our experiments, respectively.
UBE2L6, the ISG15 E2 transferring enzyme, was detected to be
ﬁvefold more abundant after viral infection. These results are in
concordance with previously published data where an upregulation of UPS genes in response to Interferon-stimulation
was detected (Seifert et al., 2010). This, together with the
increased abundance of the transcription factor IRF9, which
induces the transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISG)
when forming a complex with STAT1 and STAT2, underpins the
interferon mediated activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.
OAS1-3 are degraders of viral RNA (Shim et al., 2017) and
were also detected with increased abundance after viral infection.
Moreover, increased protein abundance of the ubiquitin E3 ligase
DTX3L and the interacting protein PARP9 as well as of PARP10,
12 and 14 was observed in IAV infected A549 cells. These results
conﬁrm the ﬁndings on increased protein abundances of PARP9
and PARP14 upon viral infection, ﬁrst observed by Becker and
colleagues (Becker et al., 2018). We were able to conﬁrm these
results using a different inﬂuenza strain, but the same cell line. It
is reported by others that the outcome of the IAV infection
depends not only on the MOI and the duration of the infection,
but also on the cell line, as well as the employed viral stain
(Becker et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019). Inﬂuenza virus infection
predispose the host cell to secondary bacterial infections, which
was shown from mice and in vitro experiments (Sharma-Chawla
et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021). Bai and coworkers demonstrated
that viral infection induced an increase in the abundance of
PPIA, which interacts and mediates protection from proteasomal
degradation of PTK2. Ultimately, this results in increased
integrin a5 expression and actin rearrangement, which renders
the host cell more susceptible for secondary bacterial infection
(Bai et al., 2021). In contrast, we have not detected signiﬁcant
changes in the abundance of PPIA and integrin-a5 in the
proteome nor in the abundance of PTK2 in the proteome and
K48 enriched data set. These differences in the outcome of the
viral infection can potentially be caused by several reasons. First,
observed differences were caused by the use of different inﬂuenza
strains. The second reason can be the infection duration and the
MOI at which the experiments were conducted. Bai et al. showed
that the mRNA level of PPIA reached its maximum at 12 hpi and
decreased afterwards (Bai et al., 2021). The use of a higher MOI
may result in a shifted maximal mRNA level and CypA
expression. The reason causing the observed differences
remains unclear. We can exclude the cell line as a cause, as we
used A549, too. In addition, Becker et al. have not observed
changes in the protein abundance of CypA or ITGA5 after IAV
infection of A549 cells, as well (Becker et al., 2018).
Response to Streptococcus pneumoniae
Infection
The pneumococcal infection induced differential abundance
of 37 proteins. Furthermore, we detected 108 and 16 proteins
with signiﬁcantly altered abundance in K48 and K63
polyubiquitination, respectively.
The protein that showed the most prominent increase in
abundance (about four fold) was PTGS2 or COX-2, being an
inducible protein involved in the initial step of prostaglandin
synthesis. In type II alveolar epithelial cells the induction of the
COX-2 expression in response to pneumococci is controlled in a
p38 MAPK and NFkB dependent manner (N'Guessan et al., 2006;
Szymanski et al., 2012). Bootsma and colleagues also observed an
induction of COX-2 by the Dcps mutant of S. pneumoniae
analyzing the transcriptional response of Detroit 562 pharyngeal
epithelial cells to the adherence of different pneumococcal strains
(Bootsma et al., 2007). They have shown that S. pneumoniae D39
and its isogenic Dcps mutant alter the expression of different gene
sets. Infection with the Dcps mutant changed the expression of 156
genes (28 upregulated and 128 downregulated) (Bootsma et al.,
2007). Given the fact that Detroit 562 cells are of pharyngeal origin
and A549 cells are lung epithelial cells, the published results
cannot be entirely transferred to our study. Nevertheless,
Bootsma et al. also observed an increase in IL-6 and IL-8 levels
upon S. pneumoniae D39Dcps infection (Bootsma et al., 2007)
(Supplementary Figure S4).
Bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumoniae use different
strategies like transmigration or transcytosis to cross epithelial or
endothelial barriers of the host. Pneumococcal uptake by A549 cells
is low, however, A549 cells show increased uptake of S.
pneumoniae D39Dcps compared to the wild type strain (Talbot
et al., 1996; Bootsma et al., 2007). Still, it was shown that
pneumococcal phosphorylcholin mimics the natural ligand of
PAFr initiating bacterial uptake in a b-arrestin dependent
manner (Radin et al., 2005; Bertuzzi et al., 2019). Pneumococcal
endocytosis is clathrin and caveolae mediated and the vast majority
of endocytosed pneumococci is killed by lysosomal fusion of the
endosome (Gradstedt et al., 2013). Pneumolysin, a cholesteroldependent cytolysin expressed on the pneumococcal surface and
released by autolysis, disables the acidiﬁcation of the endosome by
the formation of pores in the endosomal membrane (Barnett et al.,
2015; Ogawa et al., 2018). The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)
is involved in the autophagosomal entrapment and killing of
cytosolic pneumococci (Iovino et al., 2014; Ogawa et al., 2018).
Additionally, pneumolysin directly interacts with actin and
activates small GTPases leading to remodeling of the actin
network (Hupp et al., 2013). Rho GTPases act upstream of the
Arp2/3 complex, which facilitate actin nucleation and is involved in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis (Sirotkin, 2011;
Sumida and Yamada, 2015; Jin et al., 2021). In our study, we
observed increased abundance in K48 polyubiquitination of
proteins belonging to the Arp2/3 complex and other actin and
cytoskeleton organization related GO terms (Figure 3A).
Moreover, the Reactome analysis revealed that Rho-GTPase
signaling is affected by proteins with increased K48
polyubiquitination, as well. Thereby, polyubiquitination bridges
the host proteome and ubiquitinome in response to pneumococcal
infection. These results are not in contrast to the ﬁnding that S.
pneumoniae D39 effectively overcomes the epithelial barrier by
transmigration (Attali et al., 2008). We have not observed any
changes in the abundance of junction proteins as it was described

by Peter and colleagues (Peter et al., 2017). This could be due to the
use of a single cell line and no lung tissue.
In our K48 polyubiquitin analysis we detected reduced
polyubiquitination in proteins involved in mRNA splicing and
rRNA processing. Proteins involved in mRNA splicing mainly
belong to the spliceosomal E complex. Changes in the
spliceosome composition may indicate an early apoptotic state
of the epithelial cells, linking the spliceosome and apoptosis
(Schwerk and Schulze-Osthoff, 2005). It remains unclear what
causes these effects upon pneumococcal infection and is a subject
of future studies.
In addition to the K48 polyubiquitin analysis, Reactome analysis
of proteins with altered abundance in K63 polyubiquitination also
indicated involvement of the Rho-GTPase cycle, whereas the
functional annotation enrichment analysis of K63 polyubiquitinated
proteins showed only negative regulation of mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization involved in apoptotic signaling pathway
as an overrepresented GOBP term.
Viral and Bacterial Co-Infection
Bacterial and viral co-infections are related to increased severity
of disease, increased morbidity and mortality (Siemens et al.,
2017; Lim et al., 2019). Inﬂuenza A virus infection, caused by
pandemic or seasonal strains, predispose the host to secondary
bacterial infections (Sharma-Chawla et al., 2016; Siemens et al.,
2017; LeMessurier et al., 2020). In our experiments we could not
observe an increased cytotoxicity of the co-infection compared to
bacterial or viral single infection (Supplementary Figure S3).
Following the co-infection we observed similar IL6 and IL8 level
compared to the bacterial single infection (Supplementary
Figure S4). Unexpectedly, preceding viral infection reduced
pneumococcal adherence to A549 epithelial cells in our
experimental setup (Supplementary Figure S9). Still, viral and
bacterial co-infection resulted in the highest number of proteins
with signiﬁcantly altered abundance on protein and
polyubiquitination level. Interestingly, we did not detect over
representation of pathways that have not been identiﬁed upon
one of the two single infections. For all obtained data sets the
pathways affected by co-infection resembles both of the single
infections. This is in congruence with a previous study where we
reported additive effects of IAV H1N1 and Streptococcus
pyogenes co-infection of 16HBE cells (Sura et al., 2021).
Nevertheless, here we have detected enhanced alteration of
protein abundance and polyubiquitination incidence upon coinfection. This effect on protein abundance was also noticed for
PSMB8, PSMB9 and for PSME2 (Table 1). These proteins are
immunoproteasome subunits and proteasome activator
PA28beta and are involved in altered generation of MHC I
antigenic peptides presented to CD8 T-cells (Keller et al., 2015;
McCarthy and Weinberg, 2015). The further increase in protein
abundance upon co-infection might be induced by enhanced
IFN-g production caused by the bacterial superinfection as it was
reported by Strehlitz and coworkers from mice experiments
(Strehlitz et al., 2018). Upon co-infection higher numbers of
proteins with signiﬁcantly altered abundance were detected in all
data sets when compared to the single infections. Still, these
observations are not reﬂected by an increased cytotoxicity of the
viral bacterial co-infection.
In the presented study we used S. pneumoniae D39Dcps, an
isogenic mutant that lacks the capsular polysaccharides. Thus,
the outcome of the study and the observed alterations in the
proteome and the ubiquitinome were potentially inﬂuenced by
the absence of capsular polysaccharides. However, the
interaction between A549 cells and the pneumococci is mainly
based on bacterial adherence to the cell surface (Agarwal et al.,
2010). It has been shown that the intimate contact of
pneumococci with host cells is associated with a reduction of
CPS (Hammerschmidt et al., 2005). While encapsulated wildtype pneumococci interact only moderately with nonprofessional host cells under in vitro conditions, binding can
be enhanced using isogenic non-encapsulated mutants. Thereby,
the induced signal transduction cascades can be elucidated and
the host responses analyzed. Although this is not related to the
pathophysiological conditions under in vivo conditions,
important discoveries were made in the last decades using this
combination of bacteria and host cells.
Importantly, we chose a MOI of only 15 bacteria per host cell
to reduce the level of host cell damage caused by pneumolysin
and hydrogen peroxide to a minimum in the bacterial single
infections and co-infections. In in vivo studies higher bacterial
infection doses are applied to study the effects in experimental
acute pneumonia or septicemia infection models.
In in vivo experiments, co-infection appears to be adverse for
the host, caused by the IAV induced expression of type I
interferons suppressing the bacterial clearance by disturbed
recruitment of immune cells (LeMessurier et al., 2020; Park
et al., 2021). On the other hand, type I interferons increase the
expression of tight junction proteins and decrease the expression
of PAFr, reducing pneumococcal uptake and hindering
transmigration (LeMessurier et al., 2013). The in vitro study
presented here is based on A549 cells grown as a monolayer.
Due to the lack of immune cells and their interaction with the
epithelial barrier in our setup, this adverse effect was probably not
observed. Furthermore, A549 cells grown as a monolayer do not
form tight junctions (Carterson et al., 2005). The scarcity of tight
junctions might explain the fact that we did not observe changes in
the expression of tight junction proteins, whether induced by type
I interferons, or by pneumococcal infection, as it was observed in
lung tissue (LeMessurier et al., 2013; Peter et al., 2017).
It can be concluded that IAV and S. pneumoniae D39Dcps coinfection of monolayer grown A549 cells shows additive, but in
the current setup no observable synergistic effects. It would be
interesting to investigate whether this changes in polarized, 3D
grown A549 cells and to determine the impact of the
pneumococcal virulence factor pneumolysin.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common mental disease, which can 
exist as a separate disease or become one of the symptoms of other mental 
diseases. With the development of society, statistically, the incidence rate of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder has been increasing year by year. At present, 
in the diagnosis and treatment of OCD, The clinical performance of patients 
measured by scales is no longer the only quantitative indicator. Clinical workers 
and researchers are committed to using neuroimaging to explore the relationship 
between changes in patient neurological function and obsessive-compulsive 
disorder. Through machine learning and artificial learning, medical information 
in neuroimaging can be  better displayed. In this article, we  discuss recent 
advancements in artificial intelligence related to neuroimaging in the context of 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

1.1. The current situation of obsessive-compulsive disorder
1.1.1. Epidemiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a severe mental disorder characterized primarily 
by frequent, uncontrollable obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. These obsessive 
thoughts are often referred to as obsessions, while the corresponding compulsive behaviors are 
seen as coping mechanisms aimed at alleviating the distress caused by these thoughts. These 
obsessions and compulsions can significantly disrupt a patient’s daily life, affecting their social 
interactions, academic performance, work, and family life (Fontenelle et al., 2006). The exact 
pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) remains incompletely understood, but 
research suggests that it involves complex neurobiological and genetic factors. Many studies 
emphasize the role of imbalances in neurotransmitters such as glutamate, serotonin, and 
dopamine in the onset of OCD. Additionally, environmental factors, life events, and cognitive 
factors may also play a role in the development of OCD. OCD is a global issue, affecting a 
substantial portion of the population. According to statistical data, the prevalence of OCD 
worldwide is estimated to be around 2–3%, with no significant differences observed between 
different countries and regions (Robbins et al., 2019). The onset of OCD typically occurs in 
adolescence to early adulthood, although cases with later onset are also reported. The ratio of

males to females affected by OCD is roughly equal (Ruscio et al., 
2010). Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) significantly impacts 
the quality of life for those affected. Many patients report substantial 
distress and suffering due to their OCD symptoms, which can even 
lead to complications such as depression and anxiety. Because of the 
recurrent and long-lasting nature of the symptoms, patients often feel 
fatigued and helpless. In severe cases, OCD can prevent individuals 
from engaging in normal social activities and may even result in a loss 
of social functioning (Bloch et al., 2008). The diagnosis of obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) is typically achieved through clinical 
assessment and psychological testing. In recent years, neuroimaging 
and related fields of artificial intelligence have also shown promising 
results in diagnosing OCD. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 
provide criteria for diagnosing OCD. Clinicians often determine the 
diagnosis by inquiring about the patient’s symptoms, family history, 
and life events. While there is currently no definitive cure for OCD, 
there are multiple treatment options available to help alleviate 
symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered the first-line treatment for 
OCD. CBT works by helping patients recognize and modify negative 
thought patterns and behavioral patterns to reduce OCD symptoms. 
For patients with more severe symptoms, medication therapy may 
be necessary. Commonly used medications include Selective Serotonin 
Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs). In 
some cases, a combination of psychotherapy and medication therapy 
might yield better treatment outcomes (Frare et al., 2004).
In summary, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common 
and severe mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. 
While our understanding of its pathogenesis remains incomplete, 
factors such as neurobiology, genetics, environmental influences, and 
cognitive factors may all play a role in its development. Although there 
is currently no definitive cure, approaches like cognitive-behavioral 
therapy and medication therapy can help patients alleviate symptoms 
and improve their quality of life.
1.1.2. Diagnosis and evaluation of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder
Due to the prevalence of OCD and its significant impact on patients’ 
social functioning and quality of life, a clear diagnosis is particularly 
important. The diagnosis of OCD is primarily conducted through 
neuroimaging, clinical assessment, and self-report symptom scales. The 
diagnostic criteria for OCD are mainly based on internationally 
recognized classification systems for mental disorders, namely the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) by the World Health 
Organization. In DSM-5, the criteria for diagnosing OCD require that the 
patient must meet the following conditions: (A) Presence of obsessions, 
compulsions, or both. (B) Obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming 
or cause significant distress with clinical significance or result in 
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of 
functioning. (C) Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to 
the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. (D) 
The disorder is not better explained by another mental disorder. 
According to the ICD-11 (draft): (1) The thoughts or impulses must 
be the patient’s own. (2) At least one thought or action must be resisted 
futilely by the patient, even though they may no longer resist other 
symptoms. (3) The idea of carrying out the action itself should 
be unpleasant. (4) Thoughts, images, or impulses must recur repeatedly 
and be unpleasant. These criteria serve as essential guidelines for clinicians 
to diagnose OCD accurately.
Symptom self-assessment scales are tools widely used in the 
diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Common 
diagnostic tools include the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 
(Y-BOCS) and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised 
(OCI-R) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), among others. 
The most commonly used one is the Yale-Brown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 
(Goodman et al., 1989) is a standardized clinician-rated assessment 
scale widely employed in cognitive, behavioral, and pharmacological 
treatment trials. It consists of a series of questions covering the 
frequency, severity, and interference level of various OCD symptoms. 
Patients rate each question based on their own experiences, helping 
clinicians understand the severity of their OCD symptoms. Other 
scales include the Maudsley Obsessional-Compulsive Inventory 
(MOCI), Zung-Ferris Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom Scale 
(ZF-OCS) (Foa et  al., 1998), and more. Despite having clear 
diagnostic criteria, diagnosing OCD remains a complex process. Due 
to the diversity of symptoms and presentations among patients, as 
well as potential overlap with other mental disorders, a comprehensive 
assessment by experienced physicians and psychologists is necessary. 
The development of neuroimaging techniques has provided new 
avenues for the diagnosis of OCD, but their application requires 
further research and validation. The combination of clinical 
assessments, symptom self-assessment scales, and neuroimaging 
examinations can lead to a more accurate diagnosis of OCD and 
provide a basis for individualized treatment plans for patients.
1.1.3. Treatment and prognosis of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder
An increasing body of evidence suggests that untreated illnesses 
with longer durations lead to poorer outcomes and prognosis 
(Fineberg et al., 2019). Therefore, it is crucial for individuals with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to receive appropriate 
treatment promptly in order to alleviate suffering and 
improve functioning.
1.1.3.1. Medication treatment for OCD
Medication 
treatment 
for 
OCD 
primarily 
includes 
antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, and antiepileptic medications. 
As a first-line treatment, the long-term use of Selective Serotonin 
Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) is the most effective. SSRIs such as 
sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and escitalopram have 
demonstrated high response rates and positive long-term outcomes 
(Kaplan and Hollander, 2003). Research has shown that SSRIs can 
provide significant benefits as early as 2 weeks into treatment (Issari 
et  al., 2016), and lower doses (e.g., escitalopram) can effectively 
prevent relapse (Fineberg et al., 2007). Clomipramine is a tricyclic 
antidepressant (TCA) that falls between SSRIs and serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and has a unique 
anti-OCD effect (Bontempo et  al., 2012). It was the first drug 
approved for OCD treatment. While clomipramine is effective in 
treating OCD and intravenous use is effective for refractory OCD, it 
comes with more common and severe side effects (Association, 
2013). The most dangerous clomipramine-related adverse reactions, 
similar to other TCAs, include seizures and elevated liver enzymes.

Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) like 
venlafaxine have short-term efficacy in treating OCD similar to 
clomipramine but with better safety and tolerability (Albert et al., 
2002). Agomelatine’s 5-HT2C antagonism mediates its anti-anxiety 
effect and helps regulate melatonin (MT1 and MT2 receptor 
antagonism) (De Berardis et al., 2013), contributing to the restoration 
of circadian rhythms in OCD patients and alleviating some 
symptoms. Antipsychotic medications like olanzapine (Koran et al., 
2005; Li et  al., 2005) can be  used in combination therapy for 
refractory OCD, often combined with SSRIs. Research has shown that 
certain antiepileptic drugs (Önder et al., 2008; Arrojo-Romero et al., 
2013), as well as aripiprazole (Soltani et  al., 2010), and 
dextromethorphan (Liddell et al., 2013), have a certain alleviating 
effect on refractory OCD. These medication options provide a range 
of choices for treating OCD, and the choice of treatment should 
be made in consultation with a healthcare provider based on the 
individual patient’s needs and circumstances.
1.1.3.2. Brain stimulation
Increasing evidence suggests that OCD is associated with 
dysfunction in the orbitofronto-striato-pallido-thalamic circuit. This 
circuit includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor area (SMA), and basal 
ganglia (Del Casale et  al., 2011; Fineberg et  al., 2011). Severe 
treatment-resistant OCD may benefit from non-invasive techniques, 
including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (Saba 
et al., 2015), deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), and 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (Carmi et al., 2019), as 
well as invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) (Blomstedt et al., 2013) 
and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Bais et al., 2014).
1.1.3.3. Psychological intervention
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the preferred psychological 
intervention for OCD. It is a structured, short-term, cognitiveoriented psychotherapy method developed by A.T. Beck in the 1960s. 
Its main focus is on the patient’s irrational cognitive issues, aiming to 
change the patient’s views and attitudes towards themselves, others, or 
events to address psychological problems. For children and young 
people, CBT is prioritized over medication (Uhre et al., 2020). The 
recommended type of CBT for OCD is Exposure and Response 
Prevention (ERP). ERP is a therapy that teaches patients to face and 
tolerate the obsessions that trigger their compulsions and resist taking 
action. It has shown good therapeutic effects in patients with OCD 
(Abramowitz, 1997). Most patients experience symptom improvement 
when treated with medication alone or in combination with cognitive 
therapy (Skapinakis et al., 2016). In clinical practice, SSRI treatment 
is often combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy for the treatment 
of OCD patients (Cottraux et  al., 2005). However, even with 
theoretically appropriate treatment approaches in place, 40–60% of 
OCD patients still exhibit disabling residual symptoms, indicating the 
need for innovative drug therapies, different augmentation strategies, 
and new physical treatment techniques (Pallanti and Quercioli, 2006).
1.1.4. Artificial intelligence in 
obsessive-compulsive disorder
At present, the application of artificial intelligence in OCD 
involves all stages of the diagnosis and treatment of OCD. The data 
used include scales, sensor data and medical image data. Without a 
doubt, the scale is the most readily available data for assessing 
OCD. A 2020 study of 400 healthy controls and 200 people 
diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder added additional 
items to the Y-BOCS scale to assess patients. The researchers studied 
OCD by building an artificial neural network (Shahzad et al., 2020). 
Wearables are also of interest because of the intermittent nature of 
mental illness. A 2023 study wearing wristbands for children and 
adolescents ages 8 to 17 with OCD explored the feasibility and 
acceptability of wearable biosensors to monitor OCD symptoms 
(Lønfeldt et al., 2023). Some studies have used daily voice and image 
information to diagnose and track OCD. In a 2022 study involving 
47 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and 17 healthy adolescents, 
researchers analyzed the subjects’ speech to explore the link between 
OCD severity and vocal features (Clemmensen et  al., 2022). 
Neuroimaging is highly standardized and easy to quantify, so 
neuroimaging has been paid more and more attention by researchers 
and doctors in the diagnosis and treatment of mental diseases. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram 
(EEG) are the most commonly used tests in OCD, and almost all 
neuroimaging-related AI research is based on them (Abd-Alrazaq 
et al., 2022).
1.2. The application of neuroimaging in 
obsessive-compulsive disorder
In recent years, the use of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of 
OCD has been increasing. Particularly, techniques like functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and single-photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT) can help reveal the characteristics 
of brain activity in OCD patients. Through neuroimaging, we can 
observe abnormal brain activity in regions associated with OCD, 
providing more biological evidence for the research and 
treatment of OCD.
1.2.1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) technology 
typically refers to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that 
analyze brain activity using the Blood Oxygenation-Level-Dependent 
(BOLD) phenomenon. Over the past few decades, neuroimaging 
research has discovered abnormal structure and function in the 
cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuitry of OCD patients. 
Following the induction and provocation of OCD symptoms, 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has observed 
corresponding changes in the activation of the orbitofrontal cortex, 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and anterior cingulate cortex 
(ACC), as well as the caudate nucleus, insula, amygdala and border 
structure (Simon et al., 2010). For example, after using fluvoxamine 
or behavioral therapy to improve OCD, there is a reduction in 
symptom-provoked activation in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex, and ACC (Nakao et al., 2005). One study suggested 
that OCD symptoms were associated with increased activation in the 
bilateral prefrontal cortex, left insula, right superior frontal gyrus, left 
caudate nucleus, and right thalamus (Schienle et  al., 2005). 
Conversely, there is research indicating that effective OCD treatments 
such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), ERP, or deep 
brain stimulation (DBS) can restore normal activity in the 
Li et al.

orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) observed in fMRI (Saxena et al., 1999; 
Mataix-Cols et al., 2003, 2004; Banca et al., 2015). These studies 
collectively support the role of functional dysregulation in the CSTC 
circuit in the development of OCD.
1.2.2. Electroencephalogram
An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a graphical representation 
obtained by amplifying the spontaneous bioelectric potentials of the 
cerebral cortex of the brain, recorded from the scalp using precise 
instruments (Biasiucci et al., 2019). It plots electrical potential on the 
vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis, thus creating a graphical 
representation of the relationship between electrical potentials and 
time. EEG is relatively inexpensive, non-invasive, portable, and easy 
to manage. However, research using EEG to investigate ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder (OCD) is relatively limited compared to 
fMRI. This might be due to the difficulty in standardizing the positions 
for signal reception during recording, making it challenging to 
determine the precise location of the electrophysiological source 
(Michel and Brunet, 2019). To pinpoint specific locations, 
low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) may 
be required (Dattola et al., 2020). The occurrence of OCD is believed 
to be associated with excessive activity of erroneous signals in the 
brain, such as increased amplitudes of error-related negativity (ERN) 
(Riesel, 2019). Using auditory oddball paradigms can elicit specific 
P300 waveforms in OCD patients (Sur and Sinha, 2009). Some 
research suggests that changes in EEG waveforms can predict 
treatment responses of OCD patients to psychotherapy and 
medication (Krause et al., 2016). In another study that examined 
resting-state EEG before and after medication treatment, lower 
pre-treatment activity in the oral precentral gyrus and the medial 
frontal gyrus in the beta band was associated with greater treatment 
response (Fontenelle et al., 2006).
1.2.3. Positron emission tomography
Positron emission tomography (PET) can provide quantitative 
biological information in the body. Depending on the contrast agent 
used, PET can explore the distribution and expression of different 
substances in the human body. TSPO is responsible for the 
translocation of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane 
to the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus limiting the rate of 
neurosteroid biosynthesis, and the increase of TSPO levels after brain 
injury mainly occurs in the injured primary or secondary regions that 
express activated glial cells. Therefore, in OCD, researchers often use 
radioligands based on TSPO to study the synthesis of neurosteroids 
(Zhang et al., 2021).
1.3. The development trends of artificial 
intelligence research in 
obsessive-compulsive disorder
As shown in Figure 1, over the past decade, research related to 
artificial intelligence in the field of obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD) has grown significantly. We can observe that AI research based 
on neuroimaging represents only a portion of this growth. A 
considerable number of articles are centered around scales related to 
OCD diagnosis, while some studies are based on social media and 
smart wearable devices.
1.4. Other reviews in this field
At present, a considerable number of researchers have noted the 
importance of neuroimaging and artificial intelligence in OCD, so 
there are some reviews to summarize the above research. A study 
published in 2022 summarized the progress of the Consortium of 
enhanced neuroimaging and genetics in OCD over the last 5 years 
through meta-analysis. However, the research based on the project 
mainly uses brain imaging to measure and statistically analyze various 
parts of the brain, and lacks large-scale artificial intelligence 
applications (Van den Heuvel et  al., 2022). A 2022 study, which 
included 24 studies, looked at whether patients with neuropathy 
would benefit from cognitive therapy. In the study, however, obsessivecompulsive disorder accounted for only two (Vieira et al., 2022). And 
a 2023 review discussed machine learning in the core areas of mental 
illness based on brain imaging. However, the imaging methods 
included in this study only included MRI (Lv et al., 2023).
1.5. Paper search and reading
As shown in Figure 2, we conducted a search using keywords such 
as “obsessive-compulsive disorder,” “artificial intelligence,” “machine 
learning,” and “deep learning” in PubMed. Considering the rapid 
developments in computer science, we limited our search to literature 
published within the last decade. We ended up with 148 articles. 
Subsequently, we began the screening process. Initially, we excluded 
articles that were not relevant to our research topic. Following that, 
we excluded articles related to other disorders that may share some 
symptoms with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additionally, articles 
that did not utilize neuroimaging data for their research were 
excluded. Finally, we removed articles that presented highly redundant 
experimental methods. After these screenings, we included 25 studies 
related to the application of artificial intelligence in obsessivecompulsive disorder in this paper, as shown in Figure 3.
1.6. Article structure
The first section of the article primarily introduces the current 
state of diagnosis, treatment, and research related to obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) and artificial intelligence. The second 
section of the article focuses on the application of artificial intelligence 
in OCD based on various neuroimaging techniques. The third section 
of the article discusses the research potential of artificial intelligence 
based on other neuroimaging modalities in the field of OCD, as well 
as the application of artificial intelligence based on neuroimaging in 
other mental disorders.

2.1. MRI
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) stands as the most prevalent 
modality for cerebral examinations, offering high resolution to depict

structural alterations within the cranium. As shown in Figure 4, a 
standard MRI examination should encompass T1, T2, and FLAIR 
sequences. Furthermore, MRI imaging possesses the versatility to 
create distinct imaging sequences by adjusting imaging protocol 
parameters, enabling a comprehensive multi-dimensional depiction 
of the brain. In examinations related to psychiatric disorders, DTI 
(Diffusion Tensor Imaging) and fMRI (Functional Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging) are commonly employed sequences, as shown in 
Figure 5. As shown in Figure 6, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), an 
evolution and refinement of Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), 
presently stands as the sole non-invasive examination method capable 
of effectively observing and tracking brain white matter fiber bundles 
Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Functional Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (bold-fMRI), an imaging technique developed since the 
1990s, aims to explore brain function by detecting localized alterations 
in magnetic field properties arising from the discord between local 
increases in cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption during 
neuronal electrical activity generation (Uğurbil, 2012). Therefore, in 
neurological examinations, MRI demonstrates efficacy in both organic 
and non-organic psychiatric disorders.
2.1.1. Conventional MRI
In a 2013 study, researchers from the Psychiatry Institute of the 
University of São Paulo School of Medicine included 37 patients. They 
used MRI to mark regions of interest in both hemispheres, including the 
lateral and medial Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC), Anterior Cingulate 
Cortex (ACC), Caudate Nucleus, Putamen, Pallidum, Thalamus, and 
Thalamus. These regions were designated as predictor variables. The 
severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms in the 
patients was assessed using the Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale). Researchers utilized support vector regression (SVR) 
to construct a predictive model for OCD symptom severity. The results 
indicated a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.49 (p = 0.002) between the 
Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale for Dimensional Assessment 
(DY-BOCS) total scores and the predicted symptom severity. For the 
total scores of the traditional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 
(Y-BOCS), the correlation coefficient was 0.44 (p = 0.006). The regions 
most informative for discrimination were the left medial orbitofrontal 
cortex and the left shell of the caudate nucleus. These findings suggest 
that machine learning methods such as SVR analysis can identify 
neurobiological markers from individual structural MRI datasets to 
predict the severity of OCD symptoms (Hoexter et al., 2013).
In a 2014 study, researchers recruited 86 people with OCD and 86 
healthy people. In this study, all subjects underwent structural 
magnetic resonance imaging. They develop a new method of 
multivariable feature selection based on support vector machine, and 
compare it with mass univariate T-test selection and recursive feature 
elimination. The researchers believe that their method includes more 
brain regions, and each region contains more voxels, so it is a more 
comprehensive way to characterize OCD based on structural magnetic 
resonance of the head (Parrado-Hernández et al., 2014).

In a 2016 study, researchers recruited 33 people with OCD and 
33 healthy people who served as a control group. The age, sex, and 
education levels of the patients and healthy people were basically 
the same. All participants underwent a 3-T structural magnetic 
resonance examination of the head. The researchers segmented the 
gray and white matter on the MRI images and measured the 
volume of the gray and white matter parts, respectively. The 
accuracy of SVM (75.76%) was lower than that of Gaussian 
regression (77.27%) on gray matter images, while the accuracy of 
SVM (81.82%) was lower than that of Gaussian regression (80.30%) 
on white matter images. This study suggests that the anatomical 
features of GM and WM may help distinguish patients with OCD 
from those with HCS. The SVM-based approach using WM volume 
showed the highest accuracy in revealing inter-group differences 
in the population, indicating its diagnostic potential in detecting 
highly enriched OCD patients at the individual level (Hu 
et al., 2016).
In a 2017 study, researchers recruited 74 people from the primary 
psychiatric services and bulletin of the Association of Tourette 
Syndrome and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (ASTOC) in Brazil, 
38 of whom had OCD and 36 of whom were healthy. All subjects 
included in this study underwent a 1.5-T head magnetic examination. 
The researchers segmented the brain structure, labeling a total of 117 
brain regions as features. A total of seven methods were used to screen 
features, and support vector machines were used for modeling. In 
distinguishing between healthy people and OCD, the best accuracy 
rate of the model is 71.64%; in distinguishing between healthy people 
and low level OCD, the best accuracy rate of the model is 77.12%; in 
distinguishing between healthy people and high level OCD, the best 
accuracy rate of the model is 71.86%; in distinguishing low level OCD

and high level OCD, the best accuracy rate of the model is 71.86%. The 
optimal accuracy of the model is 73.68%. Although the database size 
is small, Chi Squared, Gain Ratio and Symmetrical Uncertainty are 
good feature selection methods (Trambaiolli et al., 2017).
In a 2021 study, 57 patients from Amsterdam UMC were enrolled 
to predict the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing deep brain 
stimulation. The researchers used Y-BOCS to assess the patients’ 
OCD levels. Due to the long time span of the patients included in this 
study, the imaging parameters of the imaging tests received by the 
patients were inconsistent. The researchers measured both gray and 
white matter in the subjects’ brains. The researchers modeled the 
model using 50-fold cross-validation and evaluated the model using 
AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The researchers found a 
significant association between Y-BOCS scores at 12-month 
follow-up and the volume of gray matter in the left nucleus, while 
none of the machine learning models built by support vector 
machines showed acceptable predictive power. Among them, the best 
model was established by the gray matter volume of the nucleus, with 
an accuracy of 57.30% (Liebrand et al., 2021).
In a 2022 study, researchers proposed a new anatomical subtype 
of OCD associated with gray matter. The researchers recruited 100 
people with obsessive-compulsive disorder and 100 healthy controls. 
The obsessive-compulsive disorder patients were identified by two 
psychiatrists according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. All patients with OCD 
included no other psychiatric disorders. The included control 
patients not only had no personal history of mental illness, but also 
had no first-degree relatives with mental illness. In this study, all 
included subjects underwent magnetic resonance examination. The 
researchers measured brain regions based on CAT 12. The 
researchers used maps of 268 brain regions to characterise them and 
used a semi-supervised method called HYDRA to categorize people 
with OCD into subtypes. The researchers found that structural 
heterogeneity was higher in patients with OCD than in healthy 
patients. In OCD, researchers believe there are two distinct subtypes 
(Han et al., 2022).
2.1.2. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
In a 2015 study, researchers recruited 56 patients from Seoul 
National University Hospital. The individual structural covariance 
based on cortical surface and thickness was characterized and 
modeled using support vector machines (SVM) to explore its use as 
a biomarker to predict the therapeutic effect of serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors. In this study, all subjects underwent MRI, followed by SRI 
therapy for 4 months, and underwent clinical reassessment of 
Y-BOCS, HAM-D, and HAM-A compositions. Based on the 
percentage change in Y-BOCS score after 4 months, subjects with an 
increase of ≥35% in Y-BOCS score were considered to have 
responded to treatment, and all other subjects were considered to 
have not responded to treatment. The researchers modeled the cortex 
using support vector machines after extracting features from 148 
regions. The accuracy of distinguishing between the therapeutic and 
non-therapeutic models was 89.0%, the accuracy of distinguishing 
between the therapeutic and healthy models was 95.6%, and the 
accuracy of distinguishing between the therapeutic and healthy 
models was 90.7% (Yun et al., 2015).
In a 2017 study, researchers collected 108 enrollees from Kyoto 
Prefectural University of Medicine, of whom 56 had OCD and 52 were 
healthy. Among these subjects, Y-BOCS was used to evaluate whether 
they 
had 
obsessive-compulsive 
disorder. 
After 
standard 
preconditioning of 140 regions of interest (ROI) covering the entire 
brain, the researchers evaluated the interregional FC for each 
participant and then obtained the FC matrix. The researchers built the 
classifier by combining two machine learning algorithms: SLR and 
L1-SCCA. The model created by the researchers could classify people 
with OCD and healthy people with 73 percent accuracy and an AUC 
of 0.81. The researchers also tested the model using an external test 
set, with an AUC of 70.1%. The researchers’ model was better at 
classifying patients who were taking medication than those who were 
not (Takagi et al., 2017).
In a 2018 study, researchers recruited a total of 42 people with 
OCD from UCLA, clinics, and other sources. All patients were 
diagnosed by a psychiatrist through YBOCS. All enrolled patients 
underwent 3T FMRI. The researchers extracted features from a total 
of 196 spherical ROIs and established a functional matrix. Finally, the 
researchers used support vector machine to establish a machine 
learning network based on default mode network and visual network, 
respectively, to predict the treatment effect. Among them, the accuracy 
of the model based on default mode network is 67.9%, and the 
accuracy of the model based on visual network is 70.0% (Reggente 
et al., 2018).

A study from 2019 involved the inclusion of 40 patients with 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and 38 gender, age, and 
education level-matched Healthy Controls (HCs), who underwent 
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. 
The patients were recruited from the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of 
Qiqihar Medical University and the Qiqihar Mental Health Center in 
China. The researchers conducted an analysis on the imaging data 
using seed-based functional connectivity (FC) and Support Vector 
Machine (SVM). SVM classification analysis revealed that a 
combination of left Crus I to left superior medial prefrontal cortex 
(MPFC) connectivity and right Crus I  to left central MPFC 
connectivity could be used to differentiate between OCD patients and 
controls. The sensitivity was 85.00%, specificity was 68.42%, and 
accuracy was 76.92%. This study underscores the contribution of 
cerebellum-default mode network (DMN) connectivity in the 
pathophysiology of OCD and provides new insights into OCD 
research (Lv et al., 2020).
In a 2019 study, researchers enrolled 54 people with OCD from 
Sichuan University’s West China Hospital and matched 54 healthy 
people. All participants included in the study were right-handed and 
native Chinese speakers. Y-BOCS was used to assess the degree of 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, HAMA was used to assess anxiety, and 
HAMD was used to assess depression. All subjects underwent 3T 
magnetic resonance imaging. Brain images obtained by the team were 
calculated for ALFF, fALFF, ReHo and FCS, respectively. Based on the 
above four calculations, the researchers used support vector machine 
modeling to classify patients and healthy people. The accuracy rate of 
the model based on ALFF was 95.37%, the accuracy rate of the model 
based on ReHo was 86.11%, the accuracy rate of the model based on 
fALFF was 82.41%, and the accuracy rate of the model based on FCS 
was 74.07%. However, the four models have different concerns. The 
main brain regions used for ALFF classification include left vmPFC, 
right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral insula; The main 
brain regions used by ReHo for classification include bilateral 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left ACC, left putamen, and left precentral 
gyrus; The main brain regions used for fALFF classification include 
right superior frontal lobe, bilateral precentral gyrus, right superior 
temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left cuneus and 
left lingual gyrus; The main brain regions used for FCS classification 
include bilateral superior frontal lobe, left vmPFC, left ACC, left 
superior parietal, bilateral lingual gyrus, and right putamen (Bu 
et al., 2019).
In a 2019 study, researchers retrospectively recruited patients who 
were admitted to West China Hospital of Sichuan University from 
2012 to 2015. The researchers included 68 people diagnosed with 
OCD and healthy people of similar age, sex, and education. In this 
study, all subjects underwent a 3 T magnetic resonance examination. 
The power spectrum is obtained by transforming the time series into 
the frequency domain. The square root is calculated at each frequency 
of the power spectrum, and the root mean square in the low frequency 
range (0.01 ~ 0.08 hz) is obtained. This average is defined as 
ALFF. fALFF is calculated as the ratio of power in the low frequency 
range to power in the entire frequency range (0–0.25HZ). Finally, the 
spatial falff map was normalized, and each voxel was divided by the 
mean value of the whole brain falff to obtain the spatial map “mfALFF.” 
Based on mfALFF, the researchers used a support vector machine to 
build a model that classified OCD patients and healthy people. The 
final accuracy of the model was 72%, and the model focused on the 
left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left superior 
marginal gyrus and parietal lobule (Yang et al., 2019).
In a 2021 study, researchers enrolled a total of 44 people with 
OCD and 25 healthy controls, all recruited through clinics and 
communities in Los Angeles. In this study, all subjects underwent a 
3 T magnetic resonance examination. The researchers performed 
deconvolution to extract HRF parameters from fMRI data. HRF is 
characterized by three parameters - response height (RH), time-topeak (TTP), and time-to-peak (FWHM). The researchers tested two 
hypotheses: (1) HRF is sensitive to neuropathology: individuals with 
OCD will exhibit HRF aberrations compared to HC at baseline; and 
(2) HRF is sensitive to treatment and predicts treatment response. 
Pre-treatment HRF predicted treatment outcome (OCD symptom 
reduction) with 86.4% accuracy, using machine learning 
(Rangaprakash et al., 2021).
In a 2022 study, researchers enrolled 188 patients with OCD who 
visited the Clinic of the National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro 
Sciences and 200 healthy people of similar age and sex. Due to 
incomplete imaging data or clinical data, the investigators excluded 13 
patients and 25 healthy individuals, so a total of 175 obsessivecompulsive disorder patients and 175 healthy individuals were 
included in the study. The researchers used EMPaSchiz as a neural 
network model. EMPaSchiz extracted six resting brain FMRI features, 
including three region-based features and three connection-based 
features. The model was 80.3% accuracy, 82.7% sensitive, 79.2% 
precise, and 77.8% specific. The researchers compared this network 
with a model built using other features, confirming that EMPaSchiz 
had a better effect. EMPaSchiz, which uses schizophrenia data for 
transfer learning, has also achieved good results (Kalmady et al., 2022).
In a 2022 study, researchers enrolled 54 patients from the 
outpatient department of Anhui Medical University. Patients who 
meet the DSM-V diagnostic criteria for OCD are jointly diagnosed by 
two clinicians. The severity of a patient’s symptoms is diagnosed by 
YBOCS. All enrolled patients underwent 3T magnetic resonance 
imaging. The researchers constructed a whole-brain connection 
matrix based on 268 subregions from brain images and used 
Connectome-based predictive modeling to model the matrix. First, 
we successfully predicted compulsion scores, but not obsession sores 
for a negative functional network and a positive structured network. 
We then found that the functional connectivity of triple networks (SN, 
DMN, and FPN), specifically SN-FPN, is primarily helpful in 
predicting individual forcing severity, with SN being a key predictor 
in structural prediction networks. These results suggest that structural 
SN and triple network jointly contribute to forcing (Zhu et al., 2022).
In a study conducted in 2022, the researchers recruited 128 
participants diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), 
comprising both adults (aged 24–45 years) and adolescents (aged 
12–17 years), as well as an unaffected control group (n = 64). 
Neurocognitive assessments included tests for cognitive interference 
and error processing. Unsupervised machine learning was employed 
by the researchers to identify subgroups or clusters within the OCD 
patient cohort based on task-based functional magnetic resonance 
imaging assessments. Their primary focus was on the activation 
patterns within three large-scale brain networks associated with 
cognitive control and performance monitoring, which are relevant to 
OCD. The researchers identified three patient clusters, reflecting a 
“normative” cluster that shared brain activation patterns with the 
unaffected control group and two other clusters, namely an 
Li et al.

frontiersin.org
“interference-dominant” cluster and an “error-dominant” cluster. 
These clusters were then further examined for associations with 
demographic and clinical characteristics. Following correction for 
false discovery rates, it was observed that the interference-dominant 
cluster exhibited significantly longer reaction times compared to the 
other patient clusters, although no other covariate differences were 
detected between the clusters. These findings enhance the precision of 
patient characterization, redefining previous neurobehavioral studies 
of OCD, and providing a starting point for neuroimaging-guided 
treatment selection (De Nadai et al., 2023).
In a 2023 study, researchers used a total of 1,024 obsessivecompulsive disorder patients and 1,028 healthy people from the 
ENIGMA-OCD consortium. All enrolled patients underwent either 
1.5T or 3T magnetic resonance imaging. All researchers analyzed 
differences in resting state functional connectivity between OCD 
patients and healthy controls (HCS). We  assessed population 
differences in whole-brain functional connectivity at the regional and 
network levels and investigated whether functional connectivity could 
be used as a biomarker to identify patient status at the individual level 
using machine learning analysis. Extract a Time series from 434 
regions of interest using a combination of functional and structural 
maps. The linear support vector machine (SVM) model implemented 
in scikit-learn (v1.0.2, Python v3.9.5) was used for multivariate 
classification. Performance was assessed using 20 repeated stratified 
quintuples cross validation (CV) and measured as the mean area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Eventually, 
the researchers created multiple models that classified normal and 
OCD patients. The overall performance of the models is low, but the 
significance is significant, and the AUC of different models is between 
0.567 and 0.673. In contrast, adult patients are more easily 
distinguished from strong normal people than children patients. The 
drug patients were more easily distinguishable from the normal 
people than the non-drug patients. Researchers believe that people 
with OCD have extensive FC aberrations, low overall connectivity, 
and few hyperconnections. Notably, most of the important low 
connections lie within the sensorimotor network (Bruin et al., 2023).
2.1.3. Diffusion Weighted Imaging
In a 2020 study, researchers recruited 176 Children from the 
Hospital for Sick Children and Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation 
Hospital, 56 of whom had ADHD, 81 named autism spectrum 
disorder and 39 named obsessive-compulsive disorder. All patients 
were examined on the same 3 T MRI machine. We used similarity 
network fusion to measure cortical thickness, subcortical volume, 
white matter fraction anisotropy (FA), and behavior in these patients. 
The researchers used random forest modeling to classify patients by 
disease type. The Mean specificity performance of the final model was 
>80%, and Mean sensitivity performance was >62–75%. In this model, 
we  found that cortical thickness in areas important for social or 
language-related behavior (inferior frontal gyrus, insula, inferior 
parietal cortex, temporal cortex) and executive function (upper and 
middle frontal gyrus), as well as inattention scores, were the main 
categorical features (Jacobs et al., 2021).
2.1.4. Diffusion Tensor Imaging
In a 2014 study, researchers enrolled 28 people with OCD and 28 
healthy people from the Mental Health Center of Sichuan University’s 
West China Hospital. All subjects underwent 3 T magnetic resonance 
examination and obtained DTI images. The researchers built a 
classification model based on support vector machines to distinguish 
between OCD patients and non-OCD patients. The model was 
verified using the leave-one method. In the established model, the 
accuracy rate is 84%. The researchers looked at Y-BOCS scores in 
patients and the distance of patients from the hyperplane in the SVM, 
and found that individuals with higher Y-BOCS scores tended to 
be  further from the hyperplane, while individuals with lower 
impairment levels tended to be closer to the hyperplane, so it can 
be inferred that the model classifies patients and non-patients based 
on OCD symptoms measured by Y-BOCS. In this model, the brain 
regions mainly based on the classification model were bilateral 
prefrontal and temporal white matter, subfronto-occipital fasciculus, 
parietal frontal fasciculus, splenic corpus callosum and left middle 
cingulate fasciculus (Li et al., 2014).
In a 2016 study, researchers enrolled 56 patients from the 
Department of child and adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology at the 
Clinical Hospital of Barcelona. All patients had complete 
neuroimaging (including structural MRI and DTI), All underwent 
neuropsychological assessments (Wechsler Intelligence Scale, 
Wechsler Memory Scale, Verbal Fluency Test, Trail Making Test, Rey 
Complex Figure Test, and the Stroop Test) and genetic data testing 
(including rationale of candidate genes selection, single nucleotide 
polymorphism [SNP] selection criteria, genotyping methodology, and 
quality control). Entropy-based information gain (IG) measurements 
were used for feature selection and two supervised machine learning 
methods (SVM and NB) were used for modeling to identify patients’ 
OCD severity. The Accuracy of SVM is 0.96 in the internal verification 
of leave-one method. Sensibility: 0.94; Specificity: 1.00; Precision: 0.95; 
AUC: 0.98. The Accuracy of SVM is 0.69 on the external verification 
set. Sensibility: 0.71; Specificity: 0.67; Precision: 0.63; AUC: 0.75. The 
Accuracy obtained by NB in the internal verification of the remaining 
one method is 0.94; Sensibility: 0.87; Specificity: 0.89; Precision: 0.87; 
AUC: 0.88. The Accuracy obtained by NB on the external verification 
set is 0.65; Sensibility: 0.81; Specificity: 0.50; Precision: 0.75; AUC: 
0.77. Therefore, the researchers suggest that SVM and NB may 
be useful in finding predictors of diagnosis in patients with early-onset 
OCD (Mas et al., 2016).
In a 2018 study, researchers enrolled a total of 48 OCD patients 
from the Department of Psychiatry at the First Affiliated Hospital of 
Kunming Medical University and 45 healthy people recruited through 
other channels. In this study, all subjects were right-handed Han 
Chinese aged 18 to 55 years. All obsessive-compulsive patients were 
assessed by Y-BOCS, and those with prominent symptoms of 
depression and anxiety were excluded. All subjects underwent a 3 T 
magnetic resonance examination and obtained DTI images. Grey 
matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid were segmented and 
smoothed. The model is established by support vector machine and 
verified by leave-one method. Four models were developed, with an 
accuracy of 72.04%, a Sensitivity of 70.83%, a Specificity of 73.33, and 
an AUC of 0.71. The accuracy of Specificity based on WMV was 
61.29%, Sensitivity 64.58%, Specificity 57.78, AUC 0.61. The accuracy 
of FA-based Specificity was 80.65%, Sensitivity 81.25%, Specificity 
80.00, AUC 80.00; The accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and AUC of 
MD were 77.42, 75.00%, 80.00, and 0.84 (Zhou et al., 2018).
In a 2019 study, researchers enrolled a total of eight people with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder. All patients underwent 3 T magnetic 
resonance imaging and all had DTI images. The researchers

introduced Hamlets, a layered harmonic filter for learning tracks from 
diffusion MRI, into the DTI analysis. HAMLET is an algorithm that 
is able to map raw diffusion MRI data directly onto a directional graph 
of trace presence and direction. This method can automatically display 
the anatomical structure of slMFB (superolateral branch of the Medial 
Forebrain Bundle) after MRI is obtained (Coenen et al., 2019).
2.1.5. Electroencephalogram
Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor measurements represent a 
temporal process that quantifies the sum of electrical activity 
occurring at a cortical location in terms of amplitude, as shown in 
Figure 7. This signal is rich in information that can be extracted 
using various techniques. Apart from being cost-effective and easy 
to implement, resting-state EEG offers the advantage of capturing 
dynamic changes in neuronal networks with high temporal 
resolution. Due to these advantages, EEG can be utilized for early 
diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and serve as a reliable biomarker. 
In high-risk individuals, EEG has been shown to exhibit high 
sensitivity (de Bock et al., 2020). Patients in a psychiatric high-risk 
state exhibit a higher prevalence of pathological abnormalities in 
their electroencephalograms (EEG) (Gschwandtner et al., 2009). In 
chronic mental illnesses, electroencephalograms (EEG) also hold 
significant clinical utility. Numerous studies have demonstrated the 
value of EEG in patients with schizophrenia, reaffirming its clinical 
relevance (Barros et  al., 2021). In Alzheimer’s disease, 
electroencephalography (EEG) is also considered a potential tool for 
predicting cognitive decline in patients (Lopez et al., 1997).
In a study conducted in 2015, a classification of individuals with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was performed using singlechannel complexity features (19 features) and inter-hemispheric 
dependency features (8 features) extracted from the data. This 
classification was carried out using a support vector machine. In this 
study, the model built using the prefrontal region of the brain had the 
highest accuracy of 85 ± 5.2% (Aydin et al., 2015).
In a 2021 study, the researchers enrolled patients with nine diagnoses 
of six diseases from the Seoul Metropolitan Government-Seoul National 
University (SMG-SNU) Boramae Medical Center. The study included a 
total of 945 patients, including 95 healthy people who served as controls. 
All subjects underwent EEG examination. These patients were classified 
using three machine learning algorithms and verified using 10x crossvalidation. To select the model, the researchers compared the 
performance of SVM, RF, and EN in terms of AUC. EN showed the 
highest accuracy, with a mean AUC of 87.59 ± 7.92% across all diseases 
(SVM = 86.02 ± 8.89%, RF = 87.18 ± 8.08%) (Park et al., 2021).
In a 2023 study, researchers recruited 550 EEGs stored from the 
Uskudar University Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, 81 for bipolar 
disorder, 95 for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, 67 for 
depression, there were 34 obsessive-compulsive disorder, 75 opioid 
addiction, 146 post-traumatic stress disorder, 52 schizophrenia and 84 
healthy individuals. The researchers used 80% of the data as the 
training set and 20% as the training set. The classification model was 
established using C5.0, random forest (RF), support vector machine 
(SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). In the established 
model, the highest accurate value is 0.841, which is obtained from the 
C5.0 model and the SVM model (Emre et al., 2023).
2.2. Summary
Table  1 shows the application of artificial intelligence in 
neuroimaging of obsessive-compulsive disorder included in this 
article. We show the year of publication, main researchers, data types 
used, and main methods used. Researchers tend to use MRI for 
research. fMRI is the data type most commonly used by researchers. 
EEG, which has less research, possibly due to the difficulty in 
processing EEG data, there are few sightings of effective information, 
and no studies have used PET/CT as experimental data, mainly due 
to the difficulty of data acquisition.
3. Discussion
3.1. Existing methods
As artificial intelligence continues to advance in the field of 
medicine, machine learning is playing an increasingly important role 
in the risk prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder (OCD). Currently, in AI-related research, there 
are two main types of neuroimaging examinations for OCD: MR 
(Magnetic 
Resonance) 
and 
EEG 
(Electroencephalogram). 
Undoubtedly, MR is the most widely utilized neuroimaging modality. 
This is primarily due to MR’s non-invasive ability to capture the 
pathological and physiological abnormalities in the core brain, enabling 
the application of tailored early interventions based on pathology. 
Current research indicates that in the early stages of psychiatric 
disorders, changes in brain structure such as global or gray matter 
reduction can be identified from patients’ head scans. Meanwhile, MR’s 
various imaging modalities provide researchers with more 
comprehensive medical information, allowing the construction of 
more robust models. Techniques like DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) 
can be used to examine white matter microstructure, thus quantifying 
the directionality and coherence of water diffusion. Resting-state 
functional MRI (rfMRI) studies have identified abnormal functional 
connectivity (FC) in OCD. Another study based on DWI (Diffusion 
Weighted Imaging) has suggested that the pathophysiology of OCD 
may involve not only abnormalities in the myelination status of the 
cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit but also in the myelination 
status of posterior brain regions and temporal areas (Watanabe et al., 
2018). Another significant examination modality is EEG

(Electroencephalogram). Resting-state EEG is a simple, cost-effective 
examination method, thus it is widely favored for the assessment of 
various neurological conditions. Resting-state EEG can capture rapid 
dynamic changes in neural network activity with high temporal 
resolution, and as such, is considered capable of identifying biomarkers 
for numerous psychiatric disorders (Mikanmaa et al., 2019).
3.2. Potential methods in 
obsessive-compulsive disorder 
neuroimaging
As mentioned earlier, artificial intelligence in neuroimaging has 
made significant strides in the context of Obsessive-Compulsive 
Disorder (OCD). However, in the realm of medical imaging, the 
application of artificial intelligence remains largely limited to MR 
(Magnetic Resonance) and EEG (Electroencephalogram) due to their 
widespread availability. Additionally, some clinical practitioners have 
turned to PET (Positron Emission Tomography) for diagnosis and 
treatment in neurological disorders. PET’s advantage lies in its ability 
to 
assess 
neurotransmitters 
at 
the 
molecular 
level. 
Radiopharmaceuticals can bind to specific targets, reflecting the 
patient’s brain metabolism and elucidating the mechanisms 
underlying disease onset and progression. A study has indicated that 
in OCD, certain metabolism-related biomarkers such as 
N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho) may exhibit abnormal 
concentrations. The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), formerly 
known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, is primarily located

in the outer mitochondrial membrane of steroid-producing cells. 
Brain TSPO expression is relatively low under physiological 
conditions but is upregulated in response to neuroglial cell activation. 
TSPO can be used to detect various neuroinflammatory conditions, 
and as such, TSPO is associated with the pathogenesis and 
progression of numerous neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative 
diseases. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) 
also holds a significant position in neuroimaging examinations for 
OCD patients. A SPECT-based study reported reduced availability of 
dopamine transporter protein in the striatum and decreased 
availability of serotonin transporter protein in the thalamus and 
midbrain, achieved through the use of SPECT scans and [123I]β-CIT, 
which labels dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter 
(SERT) (Hesse et al., 2005). Furthermore, certain organic changes 
that lead to psychiatric disorders can be  examined using CT 
(Computed Tomography). In fact, in neuroimaging research, progress 
has been made in all imaging modalities that can provide insights 
into a patient’s brain condition. These OCD-related biomarkers are 
identifiable through artificial means. Therefore, the primary 
limitation hindering researchers from building models based on 
other imaging methods is the lower prevalence of these alternative 
imaging techniques in OCD and the difficulty in gathering a sufficient 
number of patients.
3.3. Application of artificial intelligence in 
neuroimaging of other mental disorders
3.3.1. Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a chronic and complex neurological disorder that 
affects both social and cognitive functioning. It is characterized by the 
presence of positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), 
negative symptoms (e.g., blunted affect), and cognitive deficits. 
Approximately 75% of patients experience auditory hallucinations, 
with auditory hallucinations being the most common (Jauhar et al., 
2022). For the same reasons as in obsessive-compulsive disorder, EEG 
and MRI remain the predominant neuroimaging modalities in the 
context of artificial intelligence research related to schizophrenia. In a 
study conducted in 2022, researchers utilized an openly accessible 
Kaggle dataset to investigate alterations in electroencephalographic 
patterns during auditory processing and their potential in 
discriminating between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy 
controls (Roach, 2021); (Barros et al., 2022). In a study conducted in 
2020, head magnetic resonance (MR) images of individuals diagnosed 
with schizophrenia were acquired from multiple centers. A threedimensional convolutional neural network was established to classify 
individuals into groups of those with schizophrenia and healthy 
controls (Oh et al., 2020). In a study conducted in 2020, researchers 
proposed an innovative multi-level convolutional neural network that 
effectively amalgamated diverse neuroimaging-derived features. This 
network demonstrated effectiveness in discriminating between 
individuals with schizophrenia and those with autism spectrum 
disorders (Du et al., 2020).
3.3.2. Depression
Depression is a highly prevalent mental disorder and is gradually 
becoming one of the leading causes of global disease burden. Given 
its rapidly increasing prevalence and significant impact on individuals’ 
personal lives and interpersonal relationships, depression can lead to 
social withdrawal and impose a substantial burden on public health. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the mental health 
challenges faced by the public. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
remains one of the primary imaging modalities for depression. In a 
study conducted in 2023, structural MRI images were utilized to 
predict aspects of late-life depression, including anhedonia, suicidal 
tendencies, appetite, sleep disturbances, and anxiety (Cao et al., 2023). 
An EEG-based automated diagnostic system for depression has been 
suggested for early and accurate detection of mood disorders (Uyulan 
et al., 2022). In addition to artificial intelligence research in the field 
of neuroimaging mentioned above, studies analyzing patients’ voices 
have also become a focal point in the diagnosis of depression due to 
the often pronounced changes in energy, communication abilities, and 
emotions seen in individuals with this condition. In a study conducted 
in 2023, researchers employed pre-trained large-scale language 
models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to establish a 
neural network model capable of assessing the severity of depression 
in patients based on their spoken text (Lau et al., 2023). In another 
study conducted in 2022, researchers collected demographic 
information and acoustic data from 56 Mandarin-speaking elderly 
individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). They developed 
a deep learning model to diagnose early-onset late-life depression 
using raw voice signals recorded by patients on their smartphones 
(Lin et al., 2022).
3.3.3. Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder and a 
critical global health, public health, and population health concern. 
Progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment are the primary 
features of Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, early diagnosis of 
Alzheimer’s disease heavily relies on neurocognitive tests, brain 
imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Therefore, unlike other 
psychiatric disorders, access to brain imaging data for Alzheimer’s 
disease patients is more readily available. As of 2023, numerous 
studies have been conducted using MRI for the diagnosis of 
Alzheimer’s disease. In a study conducted in 2022, a novel model 
was developed, which utilized brain tissue segmentation from MRI 
data. This model employed a combination of Extreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
techniques to classify Alzheimer’s disease based on segmented brain 
tissues (Tuan et al., 2022). Simultaneously, there is a substantial 
body of research focused on diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease based 
on EEG (Electroencephalogram) data (Bi and Wang, 2019; 
Alessandrini et al., 2022). Furthermore, due to the accumulation of 
hyperphosphorylated and pathologically misfolded tau proteins 
being a primary and most common hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD), there is also research exploring early detection of the 
prodromal stages of AD using tauPET, as shown in Figure 8 (Jo 
et al., 2020).
3.3.4. Post-traumatic stress disorder
Trauma exposure can lead to a range of psychiatric disorders, 
including depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar mood disorders, 
personality disorders, psychosis, and trauma-related disorders, 
particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a 
pathological diagnosis characterized by a history of trauma exposure 
and the presence of symptoms lasting for at least 1 month. These

symptoms stem from at least one of four clusters: intrusion, avoidance, 
negative alterations in mood and cognition, and arousal and reactivity 
(Compean and Hamner, 2019). In a study conducted in 2023, an 
EEG-based approach was employed, integrating Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks 
in a multi-input CNN-LSTM architecture. This deep learning model 
demonstrated high accuracy in identifying fear emotions from 
physiological signals (Masuda and Yairi, 2023). In another study 
utilizing resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), data from 91 
individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 126 
trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD were included. This 
research employed a combination of deep learning and graph theorybased brain features to detect post-traumatic stress disorder at the 
individual level using rs-fMRI data (Zhu et al., 2021).
3.3.5. Anxiety disorder
Anxiety disorders are a common group of mental health disorders 
that are often characterized by excessive arousal, excessive fear and 
worry that are disproportionate to actual threats or dangers, and 
significantly interfere with normal daily functioning (Olthuis et al., 
2016). Anxiety disorders often combine with multiple mental 
disorders, such as mood disorders, substance abuse, or personality 
disorders (Andrews et al., 2001; Olatunji et al., 2007; Barrera and 
Norton, 2009). There are many types of anxiety disorders, including 
social anxiety disorder, panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, 
agoraphobia, dissociative anxiety disorder, and selective mutism. In a 
2023 study, researchers used data from the IMAGEN database to 
incorporate patient MRI to assess anxiety in adolescents. Using three 
machine learning methods, logistic regression (LR), support vector 
machine (SVM), and Random forest (RF), the researchers built 
models to demonstrate the correlation between gray matter volume 
and anxiety (Chavanne et al., 2023). In a 2022 study, researchers used 
EEG data to classify people with a wide range of anxiety disorders and 
healthy people. The accuracy of the model was 97.83 ± 0.40%, 
sensitivity 97.55 ± 0.31%, specificity 97.78 ± 0.36% of specificity, and 
F1 97.95 ± 0.17% (Shen et al., 2022).
4. Conclusion
With the advancement of medicine, clinical practitioners have 
gained a deeper understanding of numerous psychiatric disorders. 
Mental illnesses, once stigmatized as “madness,” are gradually 
being accepted as manageable or treatable conditions. For 
healthcare professionals and patients alike, quantifying the 
diagnosis of mental disorders serves multiple purposes. On one 
hand, it aids in demystifying the enigma surrounding mental 
illness, thereby reducing potential discrimination. On the other 
hand, it facilitates more precise diagnoses and personalized 
treatment strategies. Although the application of artificial 
intelligence in neurological disorders is still in its infancy, some 
researchers are content with extracting interpretable biomarkers. 
Nevertheless, this field holds significant promise. AI based on 
neuroimaging possesses the capability to identify subtle alterations 
in mental illnesses by extracting complex and abstract features, 
surpassing diagnostic capabilities rooted solely in clinical 
experience. In this article, we discuss the application of artificial 
intelligence in neuroimaging of individuals with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder (OCD). Most of the studies included in this 
article are based on brain atlases. We  believe that extracting 
interpretable features based on brain atlases is an important 
research direction in the field of psychiatric neuroimaging. 
Therefore, we consider this to be highly beneficial for researchers 
in the field of mental disorders conducting quantitative studies on 
psychiatric illnesses. The application of artificial intelligence in 
OCD has two important implications. First of all, AI can directly 
build diagnosis and treatment prediction models for patients from 
images and medical record information, which not only reduces 
the workload of clinicians, but also provides important support for 
clinical work. Secondly, in the process of interpreting or feature 
screening the machine learning model established by 
neuroimaging, the occurrence and development principle of OCD 
is actually explored. Researchers can further deepen their 
understanding of OCD by identifying differences in neuroimage 
performance associated with OCD. Furthermore, the widespread 
adoption of neuroimaging examinations across various types of 
psychiatric disorders, coupled with comprehensive, systematic, and 
long-term follow-up data, may pave the way for the development 
of large-scale AI models in this field.

Secondary bacterial infections following inﬂuenza infection are a pressing problem facing
respiratory medicine. Although antibiotic treatment has been highly successful over recent
decades, fatalities due to secondary bacterial infections remain one of the leading causes
of death associated with inﬂuenza. We have assessed whether administration of a bacterial extract alone is sufﬁcient to potentiate immune responses and protect against primary
infection with inﬂuenza, and secondary infections with either Streptococcus pneumoniae or
Klebsiella pneumoniae in mice.We show that oral administration with the bacterial extract,
OM-85, leads to a maturation of dendritic cells and B-cells characterized by increases in
MHC II, CD86, and CD40, and a reduction in ICOSL. Improved immune responsiveness
against inﬂuenza virus reduced the threshold of susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, and thus protected the mice.The protection was associated with enhanced polyclonal
B-cell activation and release of antibodies that were effective at neutralizing the virus.Taken
together, these data show that oral administration of bacterial extracts provides sufﬁcient
mucosal immune stimulation to protect mice against a respiratory tract viral infection and
associated sequelae.
Keywords: inﬂuenza, lung, super-infection
INTRODUCTION
Recurrent respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality, with therapeutic options largely limited
to traditional antibiotic treatments (1). The cause of susceptibility
to RTIs is varied,but overall reﬂects an inability of the immune system to prevent productive infections (2). Thus, treatment regimes
that enhance the immune system’s effectiveness are a valid and
rational approach.
The immune system is immature at birth,and following microbial colonization and host-microbe interactions, it matures and
develops the capacity to effectively control infections (3). Studies utilizing axenic (germ-free) mice, which harbor no microbes,
have shown that in the absence of microbial colonization, there
is lymphopenia, drastically reduced levels of mucosal IgA, and
impaired epithelial barrier integrity (4). Recent research highlights
the importance of host–microbe interactions in both health and
disease, and these data support the concept of modulating the
host microbiota by utilizing prebiotics or probiotics for disease
prevention (5). An alternative approach is the direct administration of puriﬁed microbial components or bacterial extracts
that provide maturation signals to the immune system (6–9).
Indeed, both clinical and experimental studies have shown that
administration of bacterial extracts can be efﬁcacious in numerous disease settings such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
recurrent respiratory and urinary tract infections of bacterial
or viral origins, wheezing lower respiratory illness (WLRI), and
subsequent asthma (10, 11).
Experimental studies support the concept that exposure to
bacterial components may inﬂuence the response to a variety
of pathogens. Mice pretreated with an aerosolized Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae lysate were protected against respiratory infection with
a variety of pathogenic bacteria and fungi, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Bacillus anthracis, and Aspergillus fumigatus (12). The same treatment also protected mice against nebulized inﬂuenza virus (13).
In the 90s, and more recently, clinical studies demonstrated that
treatment with a bacterial extract, OM-85 (marketed as BronchoVaxom, Broncho-Munal, Ommunal, Paxoral, Vaxoral), was effective against different RTIs (14–17). Efﬁcacy in reducing morbidity
was also shown with OM-85 in children affected by recurrent
RTIs (18) and signiﬁcantly reduced the rate and duration of virusinduced WLRI in preschool children with acute RTI (19). As with
the general inﬂuence of microbial colonization, the immune stimulatory pathways elicited by bacterial extracts are varied. Recent
data indicate that TLR4 and TLR2 could be stimulated by OM-85
(20), and an inﬂuence upon expansion of T regulatory cells and
enhancement of T helper type 1 responses has been reported (21).
In the present investigation, we have assessed the efﬁcacy and
mechanism of action of OM-85 in mouse models of respiratory
infections. OM-85’s active principle ingredients are composed
of soluble extracts of lysates from 21 bacterial strains (5 pathogenic bacterial genera) that are mainly responsible for RTIs [H.

Klebsiella (pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae and pneumoniae ssp.

Enhanced mucosal antibody production and protection
ozaenae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis]. It is
utilized in adults and in children as of 12 months of age for
immunotherapy, prevention of recurrent infections of the respiratory system and acute and chronic bronchitis, and co-medication
in the treatment of acute respiratory infections. We show that
treatment of mice with OM-85 acts to enhance innate and adaptive arms of the immune system with consequently improved
control of inﬂuenza virus infection. As reported previously in
inﬂuenza vaccination studies (22, 23), such enhanced immunity
had highly relevant consequences for secondary infections, where
it led to improved outcomes following subsequent challenge by
either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The mechanism
of action underlying the OM-85 mediated protective effect was
unique in that it involved the induction of polyclonal mucosal
antibody responses that neutralized viral particles, thus blocking
the infection. This innate antiviral response was also associated
with enhanced adaptive CD8+ T-cell response, indicating that the
actions of OM-85 were multifactorial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MICE AND INFECTIONS
Female BALB/c mice aged 8 weeks were purchased from Charles
River. Inﬂuenza virus strain PR8 (A/Puerto Rico8/34, H1N1)
was sourced from Virpur (San Diego). Viral infections were performed by intranasal administration of 100 PFU of virus in 50 µl
of PBS. S. pneumoniae strain D39 glycerol stocks were inoculated into 5 ml of BHI Broth and incubated overnight at 37°C
and 5% CO2, without shaking. After 24 h, 50 ml of BHI broth
was inoculated with 500 µl of overnight stationary culture in a
250 ml ﬂask, and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2, without shaking.
The culture was sampled at several time points (5, 6, 7, and 8 h),
O.D. 620 nm was determined and CFU/ml controlled by plating bacteria on Mueller Hinton + 5% sheep blood agar plates.
Mice were infected intranasally with 50 µl of the bacterial solution containing 1 × 105 CFU. For preparation of K. pneumoniae,
5 ml of Nutrient Broth (NB) was inoculated with glycerol stock in
a 14 ml round-bottomed tube and incubated at 37°C with shaking. After 24 h, 50 ml of NB was inoculated with 500 µl of the
overnight stationary culture in a 250 ml ﬂask followed by incubation at 37°C with shaking. The culture was sampled at several
time points to measure O.D. at 620 nm and CFU/ml controlled
by plating bacteria on NB plates. Mice were infected with 50 µl
of the bacterial solution (endotoxin and DNA free content) containing 101 CFU of bacteria. For in vivo experiments, daily gavage
of mice with 7.2 mg of OM-85-active principle (corresponding
to 320 µL concentrate) or its equivalent without bacterial extract
(referred to as “control solution”) was performed during 10 days.
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines and Swiss Federal and Cantonal Laws on
Animal Protection.
Quantiﬁcation of bacterial load in blood
Twenty-four hours following infection, blood was sampled and
serially diluted followed by plating on LB (Klebsiella) or Mueller
Hinton + 5% sheep blood (Streptococcus) agar plates and incubation overnight at 37°C. Following 24 hours of incubation,bacterial
colonies were counted and CFUs extrapolated.
Disease scoring
In all, 1 point for a healthy mouse; 2 points for a mouse showing signs of malaise, including slight piloerection, slightly changed
gait, and increased ambulation; 3 points for a mouse showing
signs of strong piloerection, constricted abdomen, changed gait,
and periods of inactivity; 4 points for a mouse with enhanced
characteristics of the previous group, but showing little activity
and becoming moribund; and 5 points for a dead mouse.
ANTIBODIES AND FLOW CYTOMETRY
Different combinations of the following antibodies were used for
ﬂow cytometry. For analysis of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in
the lung, a combination of CD11b PerCP-Cy5.5, CD11c APCCy7, B220 FITC, MHC II Alexa Fluor 700, CD40 PE, ICOS-L
PE, CD80 PE, or CD86 PE was used. Analysis of B-cells subsets was performed with CD19 PE, CD23 PE-Cy7, CD21 Paciﬁc
Blue, IgD FITC, and IgM APC. Inﬂuenza-speciﬁc CD8+ T-cells
were stained with NP-tetramer 366–374. All antibodies were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego) unless indicated. Stained cells
were acquired on a BD FACS CANTO or LSRII and analyzed with
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
QUANTITATIVE REAL-TIME PCR
Total RNA was puriﬁed from cells obtained from whole
lung and trachea of mice using Tri reagent (Sigma Aldrich).
Real-time PCR was carried out according to manufacturers’ instructions using the quantifast SYBR green RT-PCR
kit (Qiagen). The following primers were used: beta-Actin
forward 5′-CCCTGAAGTACCCCATTGAAC-3′ and reverse 5′CTTTTCACGGTTGGCCTTAG-3′; inﬂuenza matrix protein forward 5′-GGA CTG CAG CGT AGA CGC TT-3′, reverse 5′-CAT
CCT GTT GTA TAT GAG GCC CAT-3′. Data are represented as
the ratio of the Cq values from the inﬂuenza matrix protein gene
to the house-keeping gene, beta-Actin.
Analysis of cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage and lungs
BAL was performed by ﬂushing the airways twice with 500 µl of
PBS/0.1% BSA. Total cell counts were determined using a Beckmann Coulter Counter. Cells from BAL were spun onto glass
slides using a Cytospin 3 (Shandon). Slides were then stained
using Diff Quick staining set (Dade Behring, Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics, Deerﬁeld, IL, USA) and differential cell counts were
determined microscopically. Percentages of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes were determined within
a total population of 200 cells.
For isolation of cells from the lung, lungs were perfused with
PBS and then digested in medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml
Collagenase IV (Invitrogen-Gibco). Single cell suspension was
obtained by smashing digested lungs through a 70 µM cell strainer
(Milian Falcon).
In vitro activation of splenocytes
Spleens were isolated from BALB/c mice and pooled. Tissue was
placed in IMDM media containing collagenase, cut into approximately 2 mm cubes and incubated for 45 min at 37°C with gentle shaking. Following the incubation, the remaining tissue and
media was pressed through 70 µm cell strainers and washed with

PBS containing 0.2% BSA. Red blood cells were lysed, and cells
were counted using a Coulter Counter (IG Instruments, Zurich,
Switzerland). Cultures with 1 × 106 cells per well in 48 well plates
(Nunc) with a volume of 500 µl media were setup in triplicate.
Cells were stimulated with OM-85 at concentrations of 1 mg/ml,
100 µg/ml, 10 µg/ml, 1 µg/ml, or 0 µg/ml.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Student’s t test (unpaired, two-tailed) or a one-way ANOVA was
used to calculate signiﬁcance levels between treatment groups,
as indicated. Graph generation and statistical analysis were performed using Prism version 5 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA,
USA). Standard deviation (SD) was used.
RESULTS
THE BACTERIAL EXTRACT, OM-85, ELICITS AN ENHANCED INNATE
RESPONSE THAT CONTROLS INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTION
In order to gain insight into whether and how treatment of mice
with OM-85 could enhance antiviral immunity, mice were treated
orally with OM-85 for 10 days followed by infection with a sublethal dose of inﬂuenza A virus (Figure 1A). In this well-deﬁned
infection model, the peak of viral load is on day 5 post-infection
and the virus is cleared by day 10 post-infection (24). Mice treated
with OM-85 had a lower viral load in the lung tissue on day 5
post-infection as compared to mice treated with the control solution, which had undergone the same manufacturing process as
OM-85, but without the bacterial extracts (Figure 1B). On day 10
post-infection, both groups had cleared the virus, as expected,
showing that OM-85 treatment did not prolong the infection
(Figure 1B). Analysis of the cellular inﬁltrates into the airways
following infection showed that the OM-85 treated mice had a
reduced proportion of neutrophils in the airways on day 5 postinfection (Figure 1C). These data corroborated the reduced viral
load and indicated that the protective mechanism associated with
OM-85 treated mice involved very early control of the infection, and as a consequence of this early control, the neutrophilic
response resolved faster. Although the OM-85 mediated protective effect in this case was linked with time points associated

Enhanced mucosal antibody production and protection
with the innate antiviral response, an enhanced adaptive CD8+
T-cell response was noted on day 10 post-infection (Figure 1D).
These data suggest that the actions of OM-85 were multifactorial,
enhancing both innate and adaptive immune pathways, but the
early innate response was likely to be responsible for the efﬁcacy
against inﬂuenza virus.
OM-85-MEDIATED ENHANCED ANTIVIRAL IMMUNITY RESULTS IN
PROTECTION AGAINST SECONDARY BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
In both human beings and mice, a consequence of respiratory
viral infections, particularly inﬂuenza, is an enhanced susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections (22, 23, 25). To place the
OM-85-mediated enhanced antiviral immunity into this highly
clinically relevant setting, we treated mice with OM-85 and on day
7 following an inﬂuenza infection mice were exposed to a sublethal dose of either K. pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae (Figure 2A).
In the absence of any treatment, the infectious doses of the bacteria that were utilized resulted in mild infections with no weight
loss, temperature loss, or signs of morbidity in the bacterial
infection only groups, while the dose of inﬂuenza resulted in a
transient weight loss (data not shown). However, when inﬂuenza
infected animals were subsequently given the low-dose bacterial infection, bacteremia was present in control treated mice,
while pre-treatment with OM-85 protected mice from the bacteremia (Figure 2B). Moreover, OM-85 treatment protected mice
from the sequelae resulting from the secondary bacterial infections including weight/temperature loss, and morbidity scores
(Figures 2C,D).

Enhanced mucosal antibody production and protection
OM-85 ENHANCES DENDRITIC CELL MATURATION
Given the protective effect of OM-85 against viral infections and
consequently secondary bacterial infections, we next investigated
how OM-85 shaped DC activation states, considering that DCs
are one of the most potent cell types that inﬂuence immunity
and have recently been shown to be activated by OM-85 (26).
Accordingly, splenocytes were isolated from naïve mice and stimulated with different doses of OM-85 in vitro. OM-85 treatment
led to a dose-dependent increase in the surface expression of
MHC II (Figure 3A), CD40 (Figure 3B), and CD86 (Figure 3C)
on both CD11b+ and CD11b−DC populations indicative of
an increased activation state. Interestingly, not all markers were
upregulated as a clear dose-dependent reduction in costimulatory ligand; ICOSL was found in these same cell populations
(Figure 3D). We next investigated whether these markers were
regulated in vivo and found similar trends in surface marker
expression on lung DCs (Figures 3E,F), although no changes
were evident on splenic DCs (data not shown), suggesting OM85 elicited a mucosal tissue-speciﬁc effect. Given MHC II and
the costimulatory molecules, CD40 and CD86 were increased by
OM-85, it is likely that this effect was linked with the observed
increase in inﬂuenza-speciﬁc CD8+ T-cell responses (Figure 1D),
although it does not necessarily explain the rapid protection
against the virus, which was already apparent in the ﬁrst days
post-infection prior to when the CD8+ T-cell response had
developed.
OM-85 ENHANCES B-CELL ACTIVATION STATES AND PRODUCTION OF
POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES
To further dissect the possible mechanism through which OM-85
protects mice against inﬂuenza infection and subsequent secondary bacterial infection, we next characterized its effect upon
B-cells. In an approach similar to the DC analysis, we stimulated splenocytes with different concentrations of OM-85 and
assessed their activation state. Similar to the DC response, CD40
(Figure 4A) and CD86 (Figure 4B) were upregulated in a dosedependent manner on B1 B-cells, Follicular B (FB) cells and
marginal zone (MZ) B-cells. However, contrary to the DCs,

these B-cell populations exhibited no signiﬁcant changes in their
expression of ICOSL except, to a minor extent, in MZ B-cells
(Figure 4C). In order to determine whether these OM-85 driven changes in B-cell maturation had consequences in vivo, we
administered OM-85 for 10 days by gavage as performed previously (Figure 1A), and then assessed IgG and IgA in the serum
and airways of mice. OM-85 treatment alone led to a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the levels of IgG detected in the serum of
mice and trends toward increased IgA and IgG in the airways
(Figure 5A). Of note, however, there was a statistically significant increase in IgA isolated from the serum or airways that
bound to inﬂuenza antigens (Figure 5B). This was particularly
intriguing because the OM-85 treated mice had not been infected
with the virus in this setting. Moreover, antibodies that bound
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also detectible in the OM85 treated groups (Figure 5C). These data indicate that OM-85
treatment had led to a polyclonal B-cell activation that resulted
in release of antibodies against multiple antigens. Although we
could detect comparably higher levels of these antibodies in
OM-85 as compared to control treated mice, their relevance was
unclear. Thus, to assess whether these polyclonal antibodies had
functional implications, we tested their ability to limit inﬂuenza
virus infection. Indeed, in an in vitro virus neutralization assay,
heat-inactivated serum or BAL ﬂuid from OM-85 treated mice
was effective at limiting inﬂuenza infection (Figure 5D). Taken
together, these data indicate that OM-85 can act to protect mice
against inﬂuenza infection by enhancing B-cell activation and
release of broadly protective antibodies that help to protect the
host against infection.
DISCUSSION
The underlying risk factors for recurrent RTIs are poorly understood,and the treatment options are limited (27).We hypothesized
that one means of addressing this clinical issue would be to provide
stimulationtotheimmunesystemthatmightdirectitinsuchaway
as to improve mucosal barrier protective pathways. Indeed, some
of the most fundamental signals received by cells associated with
the mucosa, come from microbes. This host–microbe cross-talk is

Enhanced mucosal antibody production and protection
essential for induction of appropriate immune pathways that limit
microbial invasion.
Overall, we have found that oral administration of a bacterial
extract is sufﬁcient to protect animals from a viral infection, as
well as the severe consequences of secondary bacterial infections
following Inﬂuenza. Huber and colleagues have previously shown
that oral administration of OM-85 leads to increased levels of IgA
in Peyer’s patch and mesenteric lymph node culture supernatants
(28). The fact that oral administration of the extract was able
to increase IgA and improve mucosal immunity in the airways
adds weight to the concept of the “common mucosal immune
system”; however, formal mechanistic data showing how intestinal responses inﬂuence the respiratory tract are still very limited.
It is possible that stimulation of immune cells in the intestinal
associated lymphoid tissue results in recirculation of cells to other
mucosal sites; alternatively, components of the bacterial extract
might reach the circulation and then directly inﬂuence cells in
the lung, or precursor cells destined for the lung. Considering the
absence of surface marker changes observed in vivo from spleen
cells (data not shown), this is, however, unlikely to be the case. In
the current study, it appears that OM-85 was capable of activating
a number of different cell types, such as DCs, B–cells, and T-cells.
Macrophage phenotypes were also changed albeit with different
markers (data not shown). The B-cell stimulation, in particular, could be considered within the context of innate stimulation
and the enhancement of a natural non-afﬁnity matured antibody
repertoire, capable of binding many different antigens. Indeed, we
found that OM-85 treatment resulted in the release of antibodies capable of binding to inﬂuenza and RSV, even in the absence
of speciﬁc exposure to those pathogens. Although these antibodies are unlikely to have an afﬁnity comparable to those having
undergone afﬁnity maturation, they were still effective at blocking
viral infection. From studies of germ-free mice, it is known that
microbial stimulation is critical for the induction of IgA barrier
immunity; now our data show oral administration of a bacterial
extract alone was capable of improving this fundamental arm of
mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract (Figure 6).
In this study, we also assessed the effect of OM-85 upon DC
maturation. Perhaps expectedly, stimulating DCs with a bacterial
extract resulted in their activation, as noted by increased levels of
MHC II, CD40, and CD86. It is intriguing, however, that ICOSL
expression was speciﬁcally downregulated following OM-85 stimulation. While it is possible that ICOSL follows different kinetics
than these other markers, ICOSL–ICOS interactions have particularly been associated with allergic Th2 responses, and OM-85
has been linked with protection against allergic responses (10).
Thus, this effect on downregulation of ICOSL expression could
indicate one important component of its mechanism of action.
Clearly, further studies are warranted in order to dissect the functional consequences of the MHCIIhiCD86hiCD40hiICOSLlo DCs
in promoting protective immunity, while enhancing regulatory
pathways against allergy.
Taken together, this study highlights the importance of microbial stimulation of the immune system for maintaining effective
mucosal immune barriers. We show that oral administration of
bacterial products is sufﬁcient to improve systemic and respiratory tract antibody levels, and that the increased presence of these
antibodies is associated with enhanced control of primary respiratory viral infection and secondary bacterial infections. These data
support the concept of boosting our immune system by providing non-deleterious microbial stimulation for the prevention and
treatment of RTIs.

Background: This was the ﬁrst randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to
compare the efﬁcacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on unmedicated
obsessive-compulsive disorder with that of the ﬁrst-line treatment for OCD (SSRIs) or a
placebo, as well as to analyze the treatment acceptability and safety of MBCT.
Methods: A total of 123 unmedicated OCD patients with mild to moderate symptoms
were randomly assigned into selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors group (SSRIs group),
MBCT group or psycho-education group (PE group), respectively. They were intervened
for 10 weeks. The Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) grade was
the primary outcome, and Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24) and Hamilton
Anxiety Scale (HAMA) grades were secondary outcomes to be measured at baseline,
mid-intervention, post-intervention and 14, 22, and 34 weeks of follow-up. The Five Facet
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) were used to
assess mindfulness and social functions, respectively. In addition, treatment acceptability
(dropout rate and frequency of occurrence) and safety [adverse event (AE)] of MBCT
were investigated.
Results: Signiﬁcant differences were detected in the treatment responses among SSRIs
group, MBCT group and PE group. Notably, treatment responses were signiﬁcantly better
in the former two groups than that of PE group (χ2 = 6.448, p = 0.04), although we did
not identify signiﬁcant differences between SSRIs group and MBCT group (χ2 = 1.220,
p = 0.543). Observed until 6 months of follow-up, there were no signiﬁcant differences
in treatment response among three groups. No AE was recorded in MBCT group.
Conclusion:
MBCT is effective in the treatment of unmedicated OCD with mild to
moderate symptoms comparable to that of SSRIs, which contributes to maintain the
treatment outcomes at follow-up. Besides, MBCT is safe with a good clinical compliance.

RCT of MBCT for OCD
INTRODUCTION
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition
characterized by repeated obsessions and compulsions (1), which
causes chronic damage to cognitions, social functions and quality
of life (2). In mainland China, the current and lifetime prevalence
of OCD from 2013 to 2015 were 1.60 and 2.40%, respectively (3).
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response/ritual
prevention (ERP) are now the ﬁrst-line treatments for OCD,
which have been developed for a long time. However, a part of
OCD patients develop resistance to them, and their limitations
also trigger us to develop more eﬀective treatments of OCD. It is
reported that 25% of OCD patients refuse to use CBT-ERP; 20%
drop out the treatment; and 15–40% are poorly responded (4–
6). In another clinical trial, 30–40% of OCD patients treated with
CBT, SSRIs or a combination develop residual symptoms (7).
Mindfulness treatment has emerged as a novel and promising
approach for the treatment of OCD. Mindfulness is a mental
state and process leading to a non-judgmental awareness of
present moment experience (8), and a severe deﬁciency of
mindfulness is considered to be a feature of OCD (e.g.,
attentional bias, rumination, thought–action fusion, inﬂated
responsibility, self-invalidation of sensory experience, selfdistrust) (9, 10). It is believed that mindfulness-based treatment
is beneﬁcial to the following aspects: (1) To integrate a less
frightening ERP intervention with an anti-ruminative and antiavoidant attitude (mindful exposure) that reduces the risk of
dropout; (2) To improve insight, reality testing and acceptance
attitude to experience the impermanence of thoughts, emotions
and sensations; (3) To develop metacognitive and defusion,
decentering and disidentiﬁcation processes; (4) To strengthen
the sense of responsibility, self-trust, self-compassion and selfforgiveness; (5) To weaken the obsessive cognitive biases,
dysfunctional beliefs and compulsive behavior of OCD. So the
MBCT for OCD program is trying to help patients to develop a
better relationship with their obsession and ﬁnd a new response
to the harmless context instead of the compulsion.
The standard CBT is aimed to change the cognitive content,
but the aim of mindfulness-based intervention is to change
the approach of relating to the cognitive content. Similar to
conventional interventions, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT) improves speciﬁc symptoms or intrusive thoughts
in OCD patients. Notably, MBCT highlights to develop a
diﬀerent mental style in OCD patients and changes the
relationship between OCD patients and their symptoms. Thus,
through neutralizing cognitive biases and mechanisms, altering
aﬀect regulation systems and dysfunctional responses, MBCT
contributes to change a series of symptoms stimulated by
harmless triggering stimuli in OCD patients.
The manualized treatment program used in this study (11)
basically satisﬁed to the structure of the original MBCT model
generated by Segal et al. (12), but it has been modiﬁed to
a 10-week treatment to address the unique clinical features
of OCD. Key features of this program includes normalizing
obsessive experience, developing trust and self-validation,
cognitive intervention and intensive training in mindfulness and
self-compassion. In a pilot study, Didonna et al. (10) showed a
signiﬁcant improvement in Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive
Scale (Y-BOCS) scores and other clinical measures, and a
correlated improvement in mindfulness skills in OCD patients
after MBCT intervention. As a well-recognized treatment, MBCT
is proved to be helpful in many mental disorders, such as major
depression disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, etc., and there
have been many meta-analysis studies reported the eﬀectiveness
of MBCT (13–18). Likewise, the rationale and utility of MBCT in
the treatment of OCD has been demonstrated.
Most of the existing research about MBCT intervention in
OCD patients is preliminary, with a small sample size (19, 20)
and qualitative data (21, 22), which suggested that MBCT can
potentially have a positive therapeutic eﬀect on predisposing,
activating and maintaining factors of OCD. And the only one
randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a large sample size (n =
125) investigated the eﬀectiveness of MBCT as a complementary
treatment option for OCD patients who are poorly responded
to CBT (23). In this research, participants were randomized
to either an MBCT group or to a PE group for eight 2-h
sessions interventions. The ﬁnding suggested that, compared
to a psychoeducational program, MBCT leads to accelerated
improvement of self-reported OC symptoms and secondary
outcomes, but not of clinician-rated OC symptoms. In fact, in
addition to being a synergistic intervention for patients with
residual symptoms, mindfulness-based treatments like MBCT
has been proven to eﬀectively alleviate acute anxiety and
depression (24). Leeuwerik et al. (25) investigated two qualitative
thematic analysis of interview data obtained from participants in
a mindfulness-based ERP course and a MBCT course adapted for
OCD without ERP tasks. Three common main themes emerge in
both MB-ERP and MBCT for OCD and some diﬀerent beneﬁts
are obtained from these two mindfulness-based interventions
(MBIs). So, we adapted most of the valid elements into the
MBCT, including the mindful exposure in the present study,
which is diﬀerent from previous programs.
Hence, unlike existing preliminary researches in which
MBCT is applied as a anti-depression program or a synergistic
intervention, this study was aimed to be the ﬁrst equivalent
clinical trial designed to test the eﬃcacy, treatment acceptability
and safety of MBCT on OCD patients, and compared with those
of the ﬁrst-line treatments SSRIs or a placebo for unmedicated
OCD with mild to moderate symptoms. We hypothesized that
the eﬃcacy of MBCT on alleviating obsession, compulsion,
anxiety and depression symptoms of OCD patients is equal to
SSRIs and better than PE, and the MBCT for OCD program
can improve mindfulness level and adherence to treatment of
OCD patients.

priori test power 1 −β = 0.8, while the eﬀect size of d is 0.8.
A minimum sample size of n1 = n2 = n3 = 26 is suﬃcient to
detect this eﬀect through a t-test at the signiﬁcance level of p <
0.05 for a group × time interaction. Considering the dropout
rate, a total of 123 eligible OCD patients were ﬁnally recruited
from June 2017 to August 2018 in the outpatient department of
SMHC. Before interventions, 11 participants in MBCT group
and six in PE group were dropped out because of the waiting
period for collection and involvement in other treatments for
security guarantee. Hence, there were 41, 31, and 34 participants
in SSRI group, MBCT group and PE group, respectively. At

the post-treatment assessment, 19/106 (17.92%) cases dropped
out, involving 11, 3, and 5 in SSRI, MBCT and PE groups,
respectively (percentage of attendance < 0.6 was deﬁned as
dropout). The follow-up rate for 1, 3, and 6 months were 74.53,
67.92, and 66.98%, respectively. Inclusion and exclusion details
were shown in Figure 2. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in demographic characteristics and baseline data between OCD
patients who completed the treatment and dropout cases.
Interventions
Interventions in the three groups were conducted in the
outpatient department of SMHC. Both MBCT and PE program
consist of 11 sessions with 150 min each for 10 weeks, and each
group included 6–8 OCD patients with two therapists.
MBCT
intervention
in
OCD
patients
was
conducted
according to the manual (10) drawn from the MBCT for
depression program (12), but adapted to OCD with diﬀerent
rationale and several unique practices speciﬁcally tailored to
OCD features (10, 30). Brieﬂy, MBCT for OCD includes a total
of 11 sessions: Session 1 is aimed at describing the concept
of mindfulness and recognizing the tendency of our minds to
wander. Session 2 is focused on understanding the relationship
between OCD and mindfulness. Session 3 is aimed at teaching
family members how to help and support patients eﬀectively.
Session 4 is about understanding mistrust and its role in OCD
so that patients can develop self-trust. In Session 5, patients
are trained in validating and using their senses to prevent
the distorted cognitive mechanisms that lead to obsessive
mechanisms. Session 6 is aimed at helping patients understand
their relationship with thoughts and develop the ability of
decentering and disidentiﬁcation. The focus of Session 7 is
on developing acceptance toward internal experience without

judgement, interpretations, and reactions. The theme of Session
8 is mindful exposure, and Session 9 is about self-compassion
and self-forgiveness. The focus of Session 10 is learning to
take constructive risks in a mindful way. Session 11 is a 1-day
mindfulness retreat, aimed at reviewing previous practices
and enhancing motivation to continuing the practices (26).
During each session, participants received handouts to facilitate
comprehension.
Participants
were
encouraged
to
practice
mindfulness exercises for at least 1 h a day at home after each
session with audio tracks.
The PE program, as an active placebo control condition,
consisted of propagating information about OCD, including
epidemiology,
biological
and
psychosocial
causes,
clinical
symptoms, family burden of OCD, and supportive sharing and
discussion (29, 31). The theme of Session 1 is the formation
of the group, including establishing rules and familiarizing the
members with each other. The theme of Sessions 2 and 3 is the
introduction to pathogenesis and inﬂuencing factors of OCD.
Session 4 is aimed to educate the family members of OCD
patients on how to help their families and themselves. Sessions
5 and 6 is about to provide information on the treatment of
OCD. The goals of Sessions 7 and 8 are for patients to share their
own experiences with OCD and to discuss their experience with
treatment. The theme of Sessions 9 and 10 is the prevention and
relapse of OCD. And Session 11 is to discuss plans for the future
and the support of each other (26).
This control group can choose to use SSRI drugs approved
by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the
treatment of OCD (Sertraline, Fluvoxamine, initial dose of
50 mg). Participants could adjust the dosage of SSRIs once a week
at most within the limit of the maximum dose in the instructions
of psychiatrists from this study. Benzodiazepine drugs could also
be medicated in OCD patients with sleep disorders, but may
not be continuously used for over 2 weeks. Other psychotropic
drugs were prohibited. The drugs in this study are commonly
used drugs with good safety proﬁles and common adverse
reactions including dry mouth, constipation, nausea, indigestion,
dizziness, fatigue, and sweating (32).
Treatment Fidelity
The instructors for MBCT were the same to those for PE:
Psychotherapists or psychiatrists specialized to OCD treatment;
Trained by the founder of MBCT for OCD (Fabrizio Didonna)
and one of the founders of MBCT (Mark Williams) to ensure
treatment ﬁdelity. Supervisions once a month during the
study were provided by Dr. Didonna to ensure the treatment
ﬁdelity as well. Psychiatrists who prescribed SSRIs attended
regular meetings to make sure that medication use consistently
ﬁtted the research requirements. We also have the quality
control supervisors to check the consistency and validity of the
research regularly.
Measurements
All assessments were carried out by qualiﬁed psychological
physicians who were trained before the program and had
evaluator consistency meetings once a month for quality control.
All of them were blind for the intervention group of participants
from the beginning to the last assessments.
Y-BOCS scores (33) were the primary outcome for evaluating
the eﬀectiveness. According to the international consensus
criterion (34), improvement of the Y-BOCS scores ≥35%
(reduction rate ≥35%) is deﬁned as a treatment response. Partial
response and non-response are deﬁned as a 25–35% reduction
rate and <25% reduction, respectively.
Hamilton Depression Scale-24 [HAMD-24: (35)] and the
Hamilton
Anxiety
Scale
scores
[HAMA:
(36)]
were
the
secondary outcomes, which reﬂected depression and anxiety.
Also, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ: (37,
38)] and the Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS: (39)] were used
to assess mindfulness level and social functions of OCD
patients, respectively.
Dropout rate and frequency of occurrence were recorded to
evaluate treatment acceptability, whereas adverse events (AEs)
were the treatment safety indicators.
Statistical Analyses
An overall analysis in all participants, involving those dropped
out in SSRIs group because of improved symptoms and those
absent in several sessions of MBCT and PE, may lead to
an underestimated eﬃcacy of SSRIs. Furthermore, we only
performed a per-protocol analysis in participants who completed
all sessions of interventions for assessing the eﬃcacy due
to the equivalence of SSRIs and MBCT in the treatment
of OCD.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and Chi-square
test were performed to compare continuous variables, and
categorical variables, respectively. Multiple imputations were
conducted to estimate the scores for non-follow-up participants
after post-treatment. The response to the Y-BOCS was analyzed
by the rank sum test, whereas the comparisons at diﬀerent time
points were conducted by ANOVA for repeated measurements
of baseline HAMA and HAMD scores as covariates. A two-sided
p value < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant, which was
also
available
for
the
secondary
analysis.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in gender of the total 87
participants, which including 60 male and 27 female (χ2 =
12.517, p < 0.001), and no diﬀerence in age (AVG = 28, t =
0.550, p = 0.584). As shown in Table 1, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in demographic characteristics or Y-BOCS scores were found
among three groups. However, baseline HAMD and HAMA
scores diﬀered among three groups even after randomization.
Bonferroni correction data showed that HAMA scores (p =
0.001) and HAMD scores (p = 0.004) were signiﬁcant lower in
PE group than those of SSRIs group. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences
were found in the other psychometric variables, including FFMQ
and SDS.

treatment responses were signiﬁcantly better in the former
two groups than that of PE group (χ2 = 6.448, p =
0.04), although we did not identify signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between SSRIs group and MBCT group (χ2 = 1.220, p

Efﬁciency of Treatment
Using repeated measures ANOVA with the HAMA and HAMD
scores at baseline as covariates, Y-BOCS, Y-BOCS-O, Y-BOCS-C,
HAMD, HAMA, FFMQ, and SDS scores were found signiﬁcantly
elevated in all three groups (Table 3). In addition, there were
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in these scores at post-treatment and
6 months of follow-up. A signiﬁcant result in HAMD scores was
yielded from the interaction eﬀect of time point and intervention.

Treatment Acceptability
During the group treatment, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in the frequency of occurrence between MBCT (0.87 ± 0.218)
and PE group (0.74 ± 0.217) (F = 6.620, p = 0.012), indicating a
better compliance to MBCT than that of PE (Table 4).
In the 10-week treatment, 11/41 (26.83%) cases in SSRIs group
dropped out due to drug withdrawal, 3/31 (9.68%) in MBCT
group dropped out due to absent for more than four times
(one was too busy to attend, one left the city, and one for
personal reasons); and 5/34 (14.71%) in PE group dropped out
due to absent for more than four times (all for personal reasons).
There were 16 participants who did not complete the 6-month
follow-up, involving 6, 4 and 6 cases in SSRIs, MBCT PE group,
respectively. The majority was loss of follow-up, and only two
cases in PE reported AEs. The dropout rate was comparable at
post-treatment or follow-up without a signiﬁcant diﬀerence.
Treatment Safety
There were two PE participants who were modiﬁed to other
treatments, involving one received SSRIs and the other received
psychotherapy in the follow-up, because of their subjective will
for worsening symptoms and requested for another treatment.
Also, the assessment result of increased Y-BOCS scores was
managed as an AE. There was no AE reported in MBCT group.
No adverse reactions of SSRIs were recorded as well.

Investigations
FFMQ score of participants in SSRI and PE groups also increased.
We found a signiﬁcant correlation between the Y-BOCS scores
and FFMQ scores at both post-treatment and 6 months of
follow-up (Table 5).
Furthermore,
OCD
patients
in
MBCT
group
were
subclassiﬁed to four groups according to diﬀerent group
members and therapists for subgroup analysis. Y-BOCS response
did not signiﬁcantly correlated to the four subgroups, showing
that diﬀerent group members and therapists did not aﬀect the
validity of the MBCT in the treatment of OCD.
DISCUSSION
This was a prospective RCT involving three arms. Unmedicated
OCD patients with mild to moderate symptoms presented
a better response to Y-BOCS in MBCT and SSRIs groups
than those in PE group, although the signiﬁcant diﬀerence
disappeared at the 6-month follow-up. Furthermore, MBCT
presented a good treatment compliance in OCD patients over the
other treatments.
In the present study, the short-term eﬀectiveness of MBCT
on OCD was consistent with most previous ﬁndings (10, 40).
However, Külz et al. (23) found that there were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between MBCT group (n = 61) and PE group (n =
64) after 8 weeks intervention in Y-BOCS. The participants in this
study were OCD with residual symptoms after at least 20 sessions
CBT, so it indicated that the importance of cognition aspect in the
intervention. People who are not responded to CBT may also get
little improvement by MBCT, which emphasized that the MBCT
for OCD program cannot just adds mindfulness exercises into
CBT, it should be an integration with its own conceptualization.
Moreover, the same authors reported that the diﬀerence between
groups became signiﬁcant in the self-report instrument (OCI-R),
and they thought it suggested that MBCT may help OCD to be
more acceptable and validated which is more sensitive in OCI-R.
This is consistent with our hypothesis that mindfulness training
is able to develop and stabilize mental states that are incompatible
with the mental states stimulated in OCD patients has been
validated. We considered that the therapeutic eﬃcacy of MBCT
on OCD may result from neutralizing the cognitive biases and
mechanisms of OCD, to shift from the aﬀect regulation systems
and dysfunctional responses to acceptance and non-response.
For the long-term eﬃciency, our results showed that the
eﬃcacy of MBCT intervention on OCD patients maintained
until the 6-month follow-up, which was similar to that of SSRIs.
However, the dropout due to loss of contact and the frequency
and compliance of practicing mindfulness skills after MBCT,
which may inﬂuence the analysis and cause bias in the longterm result were important factors. We did not detect signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in treatment responses at follow-up period between
PE and the other two groups, which was consistent with previous
research (23). It may be attributed to a placebo eﬀect and group
supportive inﬂuence, especially the setting of 10 weeks of PE
group, aiming to be consistent with MBCT program. Secondly,
although randomization was conducted, baseline anxiety and
depression symptoms in PE group were milder than those in
other groups, and the conclusion still exited after covariate
analysis for balancing. Thirdly, dropout cases and two reporting
AEs in PE group may inﬂuence the results. Furthermore, MBCT
and PE were applied by the same treatment group, aiming to
avoid therapist bias, but this may also inﬂuence the results in PE
group regardless of the randomization and supervision.
Consistent with a previous study (24), MBCT interventions
signiﬁcantly improved depression, anxiety and quality of life,
which are predisposing, activating and maintaining factors
of OCD. There was a study compared MBCT with stress
management training (SMT) in treating OCD, which also showed
the advantages in relief to certain dysfunctional beliefs and stress
(41). Interestingly, the mindfulness level of OCD patients in the
three groups all increased at the same pace, although those in
SSRI and PE groups never received mindfulness therapy. Further
analysis indicated that the increased level of mindfulness was
correlated to reduced Y-BOCS scores, indicating that a high level
of mindfulness was beneﬁcial to alleviate OCD symptoms, and in
turn, remission of OCD symptoms increased mindfulness level.
Compared with the 20–25% dropout rate for CBT-ERP
(5) and 26.83% of that for SSRIs, MBCT showed a good
compliance, which supported the suggestion that mindfulnessbased treatment for OCD might reduce dropout rate or attrition
in psychological therapy (23, 42). It is considered that the high
dropout rate for ERP is related to the exposure leading to a high
level of anxiety, which cannot be well-tolerated by individuals
suﬀering from OCD. On the other hand, mindfulness practice
is an eﬀective form of exposure because it helps individuals
intentionally face their own thoughts, emotions and sensations
as they arise rather than reacting to them (9). Instead, they
learn to accept those thoughts, emotions, and sensations for the
harmless and impermanent mental events they are handling with.
Therefore, the combination of mindfulness-based treatment with
traditional psychotherapy may be eﬀective in changing the
symptoms and enhancing treatment compliance. Furthermore,
our results showed that MBCT treatment eﬃcacy was not
inﬂuenced by involved patients and therapists, and time points.
Thus, we considered that the 10-week MBCT in the treatment of
OCD is well acceptable and safe, which should be popularized in
clinical application.
Limitations
There were still some confounders in this study. The study
sample was not good enough, which included more men
than women overall and that baseline scores for anxiety and
depression in the PE group were still lower than those in the

RCT of MBCT for OCD
other two groups even after the randomization. Participants in
PE program also got 10 weeks intervention, which may result
in more improvement than normal 8 weeks psycho-education
intervention. These factors may contribute to the bias of the
results, heightened the improvement of PE. But still, the outcome
of PE was beyond our expectation because we considered that
PE was only an active placebo generally presenting a supportive
role. Also, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between intervention groups
(MBCT and SSRIs) and placebo group (PE) was only showed
in the comparison of clinical response, but not in the repeated
measures ANOVA of scores. So that, the speciﬁc function
of PE should be future investigated. Also, for the SSRIs
group, this study limited the dose and range of medication
administered, but did not record the process of medication
adjustment for each participant in detail, which may be relevant
to the eﬃcacy of the medication. In future studies, medication
administration in the SSRIs group needs to be included in a more
detailed analysis.
Another limitation in the present study is that we used the
active placebo as the comparison. In the future research, the
therapeutic eﬃcacy of MBCT on OCD should be compared
with other ﬁrst-line interventions like CBT. In addition, OCD
patients with severe symptoms or other psychiatric conditions
were excluded from this study, and these certain population
needs to be concerned. We conjecture that medication may
be more eﬀective for more severe OCD and that the gap
would be more signiﬁcant in the PE group, but given the
ethical issues, using CBT as a control group would be a more
appropriate choice.
And the long-term eﬀects of MBCT on OCD patients like
the subsequent practice require more research. Further study
should collect detail data about the frequency and duration of
mindfulness practices beyond the sessions. Meanwhile, group
support factors and practice conditions may also be beneﬁt to
the treatment of OCD, and in this study, the patients from SSRIs
cannot get the group support compared with those from MBCT
and PE, which may lead to a relatively less signiﬁcant eﬀect of
the medicine, so in-depth exploratory researches for the speciﬁc
eﬀectiveness factors of MBCT for OCD should be conducted in
the future.
Moreover,
the
DSM-5
removed
obsessive-compulsive
disorder from the category of anxiety disorders and deﬁned it
as a separate spectrum, and we also know that there are many
diﬀerent subtypes of OCD, but in this study we did not segment
the diﬀerent types of OCD for analysis. So whether the MBCT
for OCD program, or a mindfulness-based intervention, would
be eﬀective for other disorders with similar symptom problems
on the spectrum and whether it has diﬀerent eﬀects for diﬀerent
subtypes of OCD are worth further exploration in next studies
and can help us to clarify more about the mechanisms by which
the intervention works.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, MBCT could be considered as a novel intervention
of unmedicated OCD patients with mild to moderate symptoms.
In terms of the treatment response, the eﬃcacy of MBCT on
alleviating primary symptoms—obsession and compulsion, and
secondary symptoms—anxiety and depression of these OCD
patients is equal to SSRIs and better than PE. But the advantages
are not signiﬁcant in terms of the scale scores.
Also, the MBCT for OCD program can improve mindfulness
level and it is suitable to be applied in clinical practice, which
is acceptable and safe. In the future, we will continue to explore
novel psychotherapy approaches to the treatment of OCD.

Respiratory tract infections remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. The burden is further increased by polymicrobial infection or viral
and bacterial co-infection, often exacerbating the existing condition. Way back
in 1918, high morbidity due to secondary pneumonia caused by bacterial
infection was known, and a similar phenomenon was observed during the
recent COVID-19 pandemic in which secondary bacterial infection worsens
the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) condition.
It has been observed that viruses paved the way for subsequent bacterial
infection; similarly, bacteria have also been found to aid in viral infection.
Viruses elevate bacterial infection by impairing the host’s immune response,
disrupting epithelial barrier integrity, expression of surface receptors and adhesion
proteins, direct binding of virus to bacteria, altering nutritional immunity, and
effecting the bacterial bioﬁlm. Similarly, the bacteria enhance viral infection by
altering the host’s immune response, up-regulation of adhesion proteins, and
activation of viral proteins. During co-infection, respiratory bacterial and viral
pathogens were found to adapt and co-exist in the airways of their survival
and to beneﬁt from each other, i.e., there is a cooperative existence between
the two. This review comprehensively reviews the mechanisms involved in the
synergistic/cooperativity relationship between viruses and bacteria and their
interaction in clinically relevant respiratory infections.

1 Introduction
Respiratory tract infections are among the most prevalent human infections and
are a major health and economic burden worldwide. They include upper respiratory
tract infections (URTI) like pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, otitis media, and tonsillitis and
lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) like pneumonia, tuberculosis, bronchitis, and
bronchiolitis (Dasaraju and Liu, 1996). World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that
4 million people die each year due to acute respiratory infections (ARI), out of which
the majority are infants, children, and geriatric patients (World Health Organization,
2020). In developed countries, it was estimated that respiratory infections account for
Frontiers in Microbiology

60% of antibiotic prescriptions (Lindbaek, 2006) and more than
30% of sick leave. The burden is much higher in developing
countries where respiratory infections accounted for the majority
of deaths in children below the age of 5 years (Bryce et al., 2005).
Both bacteria and viruses have been found to cause respiratory
infections in humans. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
aureus, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common
bacterial
pathogens
detected
in
respiratory
tract
infections
(Cappelletty, 1998; Burillo and Bouza, 2010; Gadsby et al., 2015).
Viral pathogens like Inﬂuenza A (IAV) and B, Respiratory Syncytial
Virus (RSV), Adenovirus, Parainﬂuenza viruses, and Human
Bocavirus account for 30–40% of respiratory infections (Huang
et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2019).
Recent technological advances have detected the presence of
both viruses and bacteria in diﬀerent respiratory diseases such as
pneumonia, otitis media (OM), cystic ﬁbrosis (CF), Coronavirus –
19 (COVID-19), etc. Research has suggested that high morbidity
during the 1918 pandemic may be due to secondary pneumonia
caused by bacterial infection (Morens et al., 2008). A similar
phenomenon was observed during the recent COVID-19 pandemic
in which secondary bacterial infection worsens the SARS-CoV-2
condition (Lansbury et al., 2020). De Bruyn et al. (2022) found
that 68% of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU developed
secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia, bacteremia, etc. In
a study conducted in Saudi Arabia, higher mortality rates were
observed in COVID-19 patients co-infected with bacteria (50%)
as compared to the SARS-CoV-2- only infected group (18.7%)
(Alqahtani et al., 2022). Diﬀerent studies have shown that there is
a symbiotic interaction between viruses and bacteria to establish
an infection. Bacteria have been found to aid viral infection by
altering the host’s immune response (Bellinghausen et al., 2016),
upregulating the surface adhesion proteins (Gulraiz et al., 2015), by
activation of viral proteins (Tashiro et al., 1987a,b), etc. Similarly,
viruses have been found to aid bacteria in establishing secondary
infection through several mechanisms, including impairment of
the host’s immune response (Ghoneim et al., 2013), disruption
of epithelial barrier integrity (Short et al., 2016), expression of
surface receptors and adhesion proteins (Avadhanula et al., 2006),
direct binding of virus to bacteria (Rowe et al., 2019), alteration
of nutritional immunity (Siegel et al., 2014), etc. For better
management of infectious diseases, it is essential to understand
the underlying mechanism by which bacteria and viruses interact
and aggregate, infect, or establish infection. This review provides
a comprehensive look into the mechanisms involved in viral and
bacterial co-infections and how this interaction played out in
diﬀerent respiratory infections in human.
2 Search strategy
The review was conducted through searches of the PubMed
database using diﬀerent search terms. The search term "viral
bacterial co-infection" yielded 3,289 results; the results were ﬁltered
to focus on co-infection in the respiratory tract and to eliminate
co-infections in other systems like urinary tract infections and
intestinal and gut infections. For the keyword "viral, bacterial coinfection," the number of published articles increased signiﬁcantly
from 84 papers in 2010 to 315 papers in 2022. Other speciﬁc
keywords were employed to study the co-infection patterns in
diﬀerent diseases. In total, 147 papers were reviewed in this study.
3 Interactions of bacteria and viruses
in human infections
Viruses and bacteria can interact directly or indirectly in
human infection, and interaction between these two could be either
positive or negative (Almand et al., 2017). Mutualism, symbiosis, or
aiding in the evasion of the host’s immune system are all examples
of positive associations. At the same time, negative interactions
occur through ammensalism, predation, or when the host immune
system aﬀects one organism over the other. The processes
driving the synergy between virus and bacteria are complicated
and multifaceted, with bacterial, viral, and host immunological
components contributing to increased predisposition of infection.
Many bacteria and viruses interact with each other and establish
successful respiratory infections (Table 1). The respiratory viruses
and bacterial interactions predispose bacterial superinfections,
resulting in severe illness, and these interactions can inﬂuence
microbial pathogenesis, including increased bacterial adhesion,
enhanced virion stability, and modulation of the immune response
by one microbe that beneﬁts the other (Håkansson et al., 1994;
El Ahmer et al., 1999). Similarly, bacterial infection has also
been found to modulate viral infections exacerbating the disease
(Verkaik et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2015).
3.1 Virus elevates bacteria invasion
It has been established that prior viral infection augmented
bacterial adherence to host cells. For example, it has been observed
that in children with acute otitis media, prior infection by
adenovirus type 1, 2, 3, and 5 signiﬁcantly enhances pneumococcal
colonization (Håkansson et al., 1994). Another study by El Ahmer
et al. (1999) also found that inﬂuenza A infection of Hep-2
cells increased the adherence of S. pneumonia, H. inﬂuenza, and
M. catarrhalis to virus-infected Hep-2 cells. Virus-induced bacterial
adherence is achieved through several mechanisms, which are
brieﬂy discussed in this section. The mechanisms are represented
and summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively.
(i) Impairment of the host’s immune response:
Respiratory viruses can disrupt the host’s immune system
through the malfunction and depletion of innate immune cells.
One of the most well-studied cases is the inﬂuenza virusinduced dysfunction and depletion of alveolar macrophages,
promoting subsequent bacterial infection (Ghoneim et al., 2013;
Short et al., 2016). RSV infection has been found to cause
neutrophil dysfunction by lowering oxidative burst and promoting
apoptosis of neutrophils, elevating the adherence of S. aureus
or P. aeruginosa (Stark et al., 2006). Inﬂuenza infection also
modiﬁes monocyte functions, inhibiting proper immune response
and reducing cytokine activity and synthesis, resulting in increased
bacterial colonization and mortality risk (Abramson et al., 1982).
Another innate immune cell aﬀected by viral infection is Natural
Killer (NK) cells, which are the critical components of the innate

Elevation of bacterial colonization by viral infection. (A) Virus infection decrease the mucociliary clearance action resulting in increased bacterial
colonization. (B) Viral infection impaired the epithelial barrier integrity by breaking Tight Junctions (TJs) and inhibiting Na+/K + ATPase pump
promoting bacterial entry to the host cells. (C) Viruses directly binds to bacterial surface proteins forming a viral-bacterial complex that can infect

immune response. Small et al. (2010) found that inﬂuenza infection
increased susceptibility to S. aureus by reducing TNF-α induced
NK cell production and impairing the activation of NK cells.
Viral infection also aﬀects the adaptive immune response like T
CD8 + and T CD4 + cell and antibody responses. RSV has been
found to facilitate reinfection by reducing immune memory. This
is achieved by impairing the interaction between dendritic cells
and T-cells, reducing activation of naïve antigen-speciﬁc T-cells
(González et al., 2008). In inﬂuenza-infected mice, a decrease in
the production of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3-L),
a dendritic cell diﬀerentiation factor was observed, resulting in
decreased dendritic cell population in the lungs contributing to
secondary bacterial infection (Beshara et al., 2018).
Depletion and dysfunction of innate and adaptive immune cells
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the production of cytokines and chemokines.
Inﬂuenza infection has been found to decrease the production
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,
decreasing bacterial clearance. Inﬂuenza infection has also been
found to aﬀect the adaptive Type 17 response. Nakamura
et al. (2011) found that inﬂuenza inhibited the production of
chemokine CCL2 responsible for bacterial clearance through the
enhanced expression of type I IFN, thus promoting pneumococcal
colonization. Robinson et al. (2013) also found that Inﬂuenza
infection exacerbates S. aureus infection by decreasing IL-1β
production, which attenuates Type 17 immunity. Lastly, Kudva
et al. (2011) found that in mice infected with inﬂuenza virus and
Staphylococcus aureus, a signiﬁcant decrease in production of IL17 and IL-22 cytokines was observed. Interestingly, cytokine release
during the acute inﬂammation stage has been found to be capable of
enhancing the growth of bacteria and prolonging bacterial infection
(dos Santos et al., 2002). Kanangat et al. (1999) and Meduri et al.
(1999) found that high concentrations of cytokines like IL-1b, IL6, and TNF-α enhance the in vitro growth of bacteria, including
S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and Actinobacteria sp.
(ii) Disruption of epithelial barrier integrity
Viral infection has been found to cause extensive damage to the
human epithelial and endothelial cells. Epithelial barrier damage
may occur due to direct cleavage of tight junctions. Downregulation
of junction proteins through the host’s pro-inﬂammatory response
against the virus results in impaired barrier integrity, increased

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a highly prevalent virus that affects the majority of
the population. The virus can cause severe disease in vulnerable populations leading
to high hospitalization rates from bronchiolitis or secondary bacterial infections leading
to pneumonia. Two early and non-structural proteins (Ns1 and Ns2), strongly over-ride
the antiviral innate system but also diminish the adaptive response as well. This review
will cover interactions of Ns1 and Ns2 with the host antiviral response with a focus
on alterations to signaling pathways, cytokine gene expression, and effects of the Ns
proteins on mitochondria.

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a highly prevalent and infectious virus. Moreover, most
individuals have contracted the virus by the age of one, and half of all children over the age of two
have contracted RSV at least twice (Glezen et al., 1986). RSV causes almost 60,000 hospitalizations
of children under 5 years of age in the U.S. alone and is responsible for 10,000 geriatric U.S. deaths
each year (Falsey and Walsh, 2005; Rose et al., 2018). In adults, RSV infection often mimics that
of the common cold, with symptoms occasionally reaching the severity of ﬂu, but is often more
severe in infants and the elderly (RSV Symptoms Care, 2018). Severe RSV infection can result in
bronchiolitis, which is inﬂammation of the bronchioles in the lung and is the main reason children
need hospitalization. RSV infection also results in a high number of secondary bacterial infections
(Heikkinen et al., 1999; Weinberger et al., 2015). Moreover, bacterial pneumonia is attributable
to RSV in 20.3% of children aged 1 year or younger and in 10.1% of children aged 1 to 2 years
old. In contrast, bacterial pneumonia attributable to inﬂuenza infection occurs in only 3.2% of
children aged 1 to 2 years (Weinberger et al., 2015). RSV is the primary catalyst for secondary ear
infections, with RSV, detected in the middle-ear ﬂuid of 48 of the 65 children (74%) with acute
otitis media (Heikkinen et al., 1999). RSV is a fascinating virus impacting large portions of the
population and yet knowledge about the viral life cycle and regulation is limited. Importantly, there
is still no licensed vaccine for RSV despite the decades of attempts highlighting a need for better
understanding the viral pathogenesis and mechanisms fostering immunity.
VIRAL BIOLOGY AND CELL ANTIVIRAL PATHWAY ACTIVATION
RSV is an enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Pneumoviridae and
the order Mononegavirales. RSV, and like other RNA viruses, triggers the toll-like receptor (TLR)
and the RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible gene I) pathways upon infection to initiate a signal cascade
that leads to the production of type 1 interferons (IFN). This activation pathway is summarized
Thornhill and Verhoeven
RSV NS Proteins Functions
in Figure 1. While RSV proteins or RNAs interact with multiple
TLR’s including TLR2 and TLR4, the TLR’s that are involved in
eliciting the interferon response, like many other RNA viruses,
are TLR3 and TLR7.
TLR3, upon binding to dsRNA (double-stranded RNA),
becomes activated and recruits TRIF (TIR-domain-containing
adapter-inducing interferon-β), which proceeds to initiate a
signal cascade that activates TRAF3 and TRAF6 (TNF receptorassociated factors). In turn, this activates IKK (IκB kinase).
After activation of IKK by TRAF3, IRF3, and IRF7 (Interferon
Regulatory Factors) are the next molecules to be activated in
the pathway. This leads to the production of NF-κB (nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and the
induction of type 1 interferon production. IKK activation by
TRAF6 does not activate IRF3 or IRF7 but still induces a NFκB response and leads to the production of type 1 interferons
(Ning et al., 2011; Shin and Harris, 2011; Kawasaki and Kawai,
2014).
TLR7 binds to and is activated by ssRNA (single-stranded
RNA), subsequently acting via recruiting MyD88 and signaling

and as a way of alerting other cells in the vicinity of an
invader. Type I IFNs consist of seven classes, including IFNα
and IFNβ. IFNα and IFNβ are produced by multiple cell types,
though dendritic cells are the primary producer of IFNα. Type
1 interferons are produced ﬁrst by the TLR or RIG-I pathways,
and then fed into the JAK-STAT pathway when they are excreted
from the producing cell and bound to an IFN receptor on
the surface of the same or other cells (Pestka et al., 2004;
Hervas-Stubbs et al., 2011; Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014). In
addition to type 1 IFN’s, there are also type 2 IFN’s known
as IFNγ. IFNγ is crucial to RSV clearance by the immune
system (Gonzalez et al., 2012). The RIG-I pathway feeds into
the TLR pathways to activate type 1 interferon production. RIGI activates MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein)
which is located in/on the mitochondria. MAV activates TRAF3,
which in turn activates TANK, which then activates IKKε leading

to IRF3 activation. IRF3 then acts as it does in the TLR pathway
(2014; Reikine et al., 2014; Zevini et al., 2017).
VIRAL REPLICATION AND NS PROTEIN
PRODUCTION
RSV has ten genes coding for 11 proteins, and in order, these
genes are Ns1, Ns2, N, P, M, SH, G, F, M2 (−1,−2), and L. In
order to undergo successful transcription, RSV requires its M21 protein, a transcription elongation factor, in addition to the N,
P, and L proteins. Other members of the Mononegavirales order,
such as its closest relatives metapneumovirus and parainﬂuenza,
only require the N, P and L proteins for this process. During RSV
transcription, the polymerase proceeds along with the transcript
from the ﬁrst start site, right before the Ns1 gene, in a sequential,
termination-re-initiation (stop-start) mechanism (Kuo et al.,
1997). RSV genes are under one transcriptional promotor
(Collins and Wertz, 1983) and can initiate transcription at either
a +1 or a +3 initiation site before the NS1 start site. The RdRp
(RNA dependent RNA polymerase) can initiate transcription
independently at both positions. Initiation at either the +1 or
the +3 site determines whether transcription or replication will
occur. Initiation at the +3 site yields a short leader transcript
(∼25nt) and then reinitiates at the gene start site (gs) immediately
preceding Ns1 to produce mRNA’s. Initiation at the +1 site
leads to full-length transcripts that are readily encapsidated by
N (Tremaglio et al., 2013; Noton et al., 2019).
Since the viral genes must be transcribed in order, the order
of genes in the genome is vital in the timing of infection.
Ns1 and Ns2 (non-structural proteins) are the ﬁrst genes to be
transcribed. These proteins, which are essential for permissive
in vivo infection, function to inhibit the type 1 interferon
(IFN) response, other elements of the immune system, and may
contribute to the high incidence of secondary bacterial infections
in RSV infections due to its interference with the immune
system (Teng and Collins, 1999; Jin et al., 2000; Bossert and
Conzelmann, 2002; Lo et al., 2005; Elliott et al., 2007; Ling et al.,
2009; Verhoeven et al., 2014; Sun and Lopez, 2017). Thus, it is
imperative that Ns1/Ns2 are made early during infection (Jin
et al., 2000; Collins et al., 2013). The non-structural genes of RSV
are unique to the virus, as they have low, if any homology, with
genes of other viruses in the family serving a similar function
(Swedan et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2012). This review will further
focus on the non-structural genes of RSV, the interactions of their
proteins, and their importance in the viral life cycle of RSV.
Ns1 VS. Ns2
Of RSV’s non-structural genes, Ns1 has been more studied more
in-depth, and thus more of its role in infection is known than that
of Ns2. In terms of immune suppression, Ns1 is the dominant
player, and Ns2 may be a minor one, though important still for
enhancing and supporting RSV pathogenesis. RSV’s Ns1 is 139
amino acids long and Ns2 is slightly smaller at 124 amino acids
(Atreya et al., 1998) (GenBank: AFM95347.1, AFM95348.1). Ns1
is the ﬁrst gene in the genome and follows a 44-nt leader region
thus making it the most abundant transcripts produced. NS1
is followed directly by Ns2 with a small intergenic region of
around 19nts spacing between the two open reading frames
(Atreya et al., 1998).
While the Ns1 protein is fairly stable after translation and
can be detected in pulse chase experiments for hours, the Ns2
protein disappears rapidly in the early infection stage and is
thought to have an intracellular half-life of 1hr. Both Ns proteins
have been observed in multimeric forms which are thought to
be linked by disulﬁde bridges, though the predominant form of
Ns1 is thought to be its monomeric form (Collins et al., 1996;
Evans et al., 1996; Chatterjee et al., 2017). Ns1 and Ns2 can form
homo- and heteromers. Ns1 traﬃcs to the nucleus, while Ns2 as
well as a Ns1-Ns2 complex traﬃc to the mitochondria. Most of
the Ns1 and Ns2 in an infected cell resides in the mitochondria
as a heteromer (Swedan et al., 2011). Furter study is needed to
explain why the majority of the Ns proteins reside here, though
it may be a way to sequester them as a means of regulation; as
Ns1 inhibits viral replication including in minigenome systems
(Atreya et al., 1998) and mitochondrial metabolic byproducts
and proteins play critical roles in the antiviral response (Koshiba,
2013; Jin et al., 2017; Mohanty et al., 2019). While being
sequestered in the mitochondria may appear counterintuitive,
the Ns1 protein is subject to post-translational modiﬁcation,
which may indicate an additional regulatory mechanism (Atreya
et al., 1998). This modiﬁcation occurs by proteolytic cleavage,
producing a 12.5K protein that is thought to be produced shortly
after the production of the normal-sized Ns1. It is unknown
what function the modiﬁcation has and may be a byproduct of
Ns1. As the intensity of the Ns1 band in pulse-chase experiments
decreased the 12.5 K protein appeared. While Ns1 is thought
to be relatively stable, the discrepancies in diﬀerent papers may
indicate that only certain forms of the protein are stable (Huang
et al., 1985; Collins et al., 1996). The Ns genes inhibit the type
1 interferon response as well, so this may allow for a pause
in viral replication until IFN production is inhibited and RSV
can replicate without being suppressed by the innate antiviral
response. STAT1 and IFNAR1 knockout mice have increased
RSV titer/load compared to wildtype mice through all recorded
time points (Hashimoto et al., 2005; Goritzka et al., 2014).
RSV has an unusual replication growth curve, with slower and
less productive replication and gene expression compared to
other viruses of the same genome type (Atreya et al., 1998).
The inhibition of replication by Ns1 may help to explain this
phenomenon, especially since it is the earliest and most abundant
viral protein.
RSV has considerable variation in its genome between strains,
and the amount of variation varies by the gene. Between the
RSVA and B strains, the G gene has the most sequence variation.
Ns1 and Ns2 have 22% nucleic acid diﬀerences between theses
strains, with 13 and 8%, respectively diﬀerences in amino acid
sequence. For comparison, the N gene which is thought to be very
conserved diﬀers by 14 and 4% for nucleotide and amino acid
sequence similarity, respectively (Sullender, 2000). Comparing
within the A strains from 2006 to 2019 against the prototypical
A2 strain, the NS1 gene is fairly well-conserved on the amino
acid level with about 97 or 100% identical amino acids to each

RSV NS Proteins Functions
other (using protein alignments). These amino acid changes,
when they occur, do appear to occur within predicted MHCI
binding peptides. Comparing NS2 strains between 2006 to 2019,
the amino acid sequence is also very conserved with 98–100%
conservation. Of interest, comparing mid/late 2,000 strains to
earlier strains from the 1980s and some 1990 strains shows a
substitution of R to K at the 38th amino acid. Scanning this
protein with MHCI epitope binding prediction software (IEBD),
this site falls within a conserved amino acid sequence that may
bind to all the major MHCI within diﬀerent ethnicities (i.e.,
HLA-A-2 and HLA-A-68). Some 1990s strains also have another
change in another predicted MHCI epitope with a change from R
to D at the 8th amino acid position. Going back to the sequence
diﬀerences between A and B strains, most of the amino acid
changes fall within predicted MHCI binding epitopes suggesting
immune pressure between the A and B strains but not as much
within each strain inside the same decade of circulation (i.e., 1–3
epitope changes between 2016 A and B strains in three predicted
epitopes). These suggest a general lack of immune pressure on
this protein as usually only one predicted CD8 T cell epitope
changes but not necessary from 1 year to the following year.
Thus, the amount of sequence conservation across strains may
have relevance for possible drug therapies or vaccine targets, but
may also have relevance for host range determination. The Ns
genes may determine host range, as human RSV is capable of
infecting bovine cells and vice versa though they are not capable
of replicating in cows. When a virus containing the Ns genes of
a non-native host (i.e., transfer of BRSV ns genes into HRSV)
and infects non-native host cells, it replicates but is attenuated
compared to the wild type (Bossert and Conzelmann, 2002).
The Ns proteins have multiple recorded interactions with
cellular and other viral proteins. Ns1 has more recorded
interactions and an enormous scope of impact when compared
to Ns2. Ns1 is able to interact with Ns2, the RSV M protein,
and is capable of inhibiting multiple parts of the immune system
(Evans et al., 1996). Ns2, however, seems to be more limited in
its inhibitory capacity as most data on its interaction record it
only inhibiting the interferon response in infected cells. Together
the Ns genes are capable of interfering with both the adaptive
and innate antiviral immune response pathways (Atreya et al.,
1998).
MANIPULATION OF INNATE ANTIVIRAL
DEFENSE BY NS PROTEINS
The Ns proteins are known to bind to and inhibit various
molecules in the type 1 interferon response signal cascade
of either the RIG-I or TLR pathways. Ns1 and Ns2 form
degradosomes that home to the mitochondria, and are capable
of degrading multiple proteins in the type 1 interferon pathway
(Elliott et al., 2007; Swedan et al., 2009; Goswami et al.,
2013). Ns1 and Ns2 have a curious relationship with the
mitochondria as optimal degradosome function appears in
modiﬁed mitochondria that are shorter and more motile. The
modiﬁed mitochondria possess a greater surface area and thus
greater access to MAVS (Goswami et al., 2013).
The Ns degradosome is a heterogeneous large protein complex
300–750 kD in size. The degradosome targets TRAF’s (TNF
receptor-associated factors), TBK1 (TANK Binding Kinase 1),
RIG-I, IRF3/7, and STAT2. Through direct interaction with
RIG-1, Ns2 suppresses RLR (RIG-I-like Receptor) signaling as
well as prevents RIG-I from interacting with MAVS to prevent
downstream signaling. While the exact composition of the
degradosome is unknown, Ns1 acts as a functional E3 ligase and
to facilitate proteasomal degradation of target proteins (Sun and
Lopez, 2017). The helix α3 structure in the Ns1 protein, which
is a highly conserved sequence across RSV strains, is thought
to be of critical importance for the function of the protein. The
helix α3 structure is important for the stability of the protein,
IFN inhibition, as well as for the suppression of DC maturation
(Chatterjee et al., 2017).
RIG AND TLR INTERACTIONS WITH NS
PROTEINS
The RIG-I and TLR pathways both function to induce the
production of interferons after contact with a PAMP (pathogenassociated molecular pattern), and feed into one another’s
pathways due to overlapping functions. An eﬀect on one often,
but not always, has an eﬀect on the other. As stated previously,
Ns1 is able to enter the mitochondria of cells. After entry, the
protein can bind to and inhibits MAVS (Boyapalle et al., 2012)
which serves as the intermediary protein downstream of RIG-I.
The Ns genes also inhibit the proteins IRF-7, and IRF-3, which are
involved in both the RIG-I and the TLR pathways (Lo et al., 2005;
Elliott et al., 2007; Ling et al., 2009). RIG-I is essential for the IFN
induction during RSV infection, similar to other RNA viruses
such as inﬂuenza (Killip et al., 2015; Mäkelä et al., 2015; Wu
et al., 2015). In contrast, Ns2 binds RIG-I directly and inhibits
its functions (Lo et al., 2005; Elliott et al., 2007; Ling et al., 2009).
The type of cell that is infected by RSV seems to have an
eﬀect on which antiviral pathway is most helpful in limiting
viral replication. The primary pathway used by dendritic cells
to target and respond to an RSV infection is the TLR pathway,
whereas lung epithelial cells use more of the RIG-I pathway
as the primary form of response and clearance (Swedan et al.,
2009). RSV infection is more prevalent in lung epithelial cells
than in dendritic cells (Olszewska-Pazdrak et al., 1998; Zhang
et al., 2002; Lukens et al., 2009; Rivera-Toledo and Gomez, 2012),
and RSV’s Ns proteins can target multiple stages of the TLR and
RIG-I pathways. Ns1 can target TRAF3, and IKKε and leads to
a reduction in the amounts of these proteins. TRAF3 intersects
both the TLR and RIG-I pathways, and its inhibition allows RSV
to evade the signaling caused by its production of viral RNA and
its F protein (Swedan et al., 2009). Ns2 inhibits the activation
of IRF3 early in infection as well as the activation of IFN via
RIG-I. Ns2 interacts with RIG-I using the N-terminal 229aa
of RIG-I, preventing RIG-I-MAVS interaction and preventing
downstream activation of IRF3. Ns2 is able to both antagonize
IFN induction and signaling, as well as inhibiting apoptosis,
promoting continued viral replication (Bitko et al., 2007). Ns2 is
able to bind to the N-terminal CARD (Caspase activation and

RSV NS Proteins Functions
recruitment domain) of RIG-I. This interaction inhibits RIG-IMAVS interaction and prevents the downstream induction of the
IFN gene in this pathway. Since RIG-I and IRF3, both of which
are inhibited by Ns2, are important for the induction of type
III interferons that this may be the mechanism by which RSV
suppresses type III IFN’s (Swedan et al., 2011; Barik, 2013). IFN-λ
is a type III interferon which is associated with mucosal surfaces
(Zanoni et al., 2017). In Ns deletion studies IFN-λ showed
increased accumulation with the eﬀect being most pronounced
with deletion of both Ns1 and Ns2, though Ns1 deletion alone
showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase (Spann et al., 2004). As
IFN-λ may prove to be the predominant IFN produced in RSV
infection this is an exciting area of research worthy of more study
(Okabayashi et al., 2011). According to Spann et al., deletion of
Ns1 and Ns2 resulted in a 300-fold increase in the expression
of IFN-α compared to mock-treated cells at 18hrs; the increase
in expression decreased over time. Deletion of just Ns1 led to
an 18-fold increase, with Ns2 deletion not showing a signiﬁcant
increase. Deletion of the Ns proteins also had an eﬀect on IFNβ showing an increase of 40,000 fold for the double deletion at
18hrs (Spann et al., 2004). Ns2 is capable of weakly reducing the
amount of TRAF3 while causing a slight increase in IKKε. Unlike
Ns1, Ns2 is able to directly reduce STAT2 (Swedan et al., 2011;
Goswami et al., 2013). The inhibition of STAT2 means that RSV
has ways in which to inhibit not only the induction of the primary
wave of type 1 interferon response but also the secondary (Lo
et al., 2005; Elliott et al., 2007; Ling et al., 2009).
STAT PATHWAYS
The STAT pathway portion of the interferon system induces
a way to respond to secreted interferons in an autocrine or
paracrine fashion to induce a secondary wave of interferons.
Not only is Ns1 able to inhibit the primary induction of IFN
production, but it can degrade STAT2 through interactions with
Ns2 and Elongin-Cullin E3 Ligase. It is also able to inhibit the
secondary induction of IFN production via the IFN receptor
signaling pathway (Lo et al., 2005; Elliott et al., 2007; Ling
et al., 2009). To achieve this, Ns1 has multiple interactions
involving the IFN receptor signaling pathway including but
not limited to, upregulating SOCS1 and SOCS3 (suppressor
of cytokine signaling), triggering STAT2 degradation, targeting
the interferon-alpha receptor and inhibiting its response,
and downregulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway through
STAT2 degradation (Xu et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2015; Zhang
et al., 2016). Multiple members of the paramyxovirus family, of
which RSV used to be classiﬁed under until 2016, degrade STAT2
as a mechanism for inhibiting IFN1 production in infected
cells. Mumps and Simian Virus 5 degrade STAT1, and human
parainﬂuenza type 2 degrades STAT2. Both these mechanisms
function to hamper IFN-α/β signal transduction (Elliott et al.,
2007). Both Ns1 and Ns2 have a C-terminal tetrapeptide known
as DLNP, which is involved in IFN suppressive functions like
binding to MPA1B (microtubule-associated protein 1B) which
is essential for the STAT2 reduction by Ns2 later on in infection
(Swedan et al., 2011).
ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM
MANIPULATIONS
The Ns1 protein of RSV also plays a role in altering CD4+
(helper T cells) and CD8+ (cytotoxic T cell) cells. Ns1
suppresses the CD103+ CD8+ T cell (tissue-resident memory
T cells) response, promote a Th2 (T helper cell) response,
and suppress the Th17 response (Munir et al., 2011). Ns1 also
increases the percentage of CD4+ T cells positive for IL-4
(interleukin) and enhances their proliferation by antagonizing
the anti-proliferative eﬀect of interferon type 1 (IFN-I). Munir
et al. show that Ns1 depresses the concentration of IFNγ
in DC-T cell co-cultures. The authors state that their data
suggests that the Ns1 protein contributes to skewing of the
Th1/Th2 balance toward Th2 during the priming of naive
T cells or stimulation of memory T cells (Munir et al.,
2011).
Deletion of the Ns1 protein results in an increase in dendritic
cells (DC) maturation (Munir et al., 2008, 2011). While RSV
induces the maturation of DC, these RSV-matured DC have
an impaired ability to activate CD4+ T lymphocytes, possibly
due to Ns1 and Ns2 mediated suppression of gene functions
or mitochondrial mediators known for cell to cell signaling.
Maturation can also be aﬀected when Ns2 is also deleted,
though Ns2 deletion alone does not yield a signiﬁcant increase
in DC maturation. Munir et al. measured DC maturation
through cell surface expression and production of chemokines
and cytokines. In the absence of RSV’s Ns genes, the markers
CD83 and CD38 were upregulated (Munir et al., 2008). It is
thought that CD83 suppression by the Ns genes may explain the
impaired activation of T-cells due to a reduction in costimulatory
function and may lead to an impaired expansion of antigenspeciﬁc CD8+ cells. Suppression of CD38 reduces the survival
of mature DC and results in a shift in T cell diﬀerentiation
from favoring Th1 cells. The suppression of DC surface markers
depends on the antagonism of the type 1 interferon response,
as seen through the use of an IFNAR2-blocking monoclonal
antibody (Munir et al., 2008). This antibody blocks the increase
in surface markers and other eﬀects of Ns gene deletion,
and in the presence of the IFNAR2 blockade, there is also
reduced RSV-induced maturation, indicating that IFN’s can
contribute to DC maturation despite the presence of the Ns genes
(Munir et al., 2008).
NS EFFECT ON CELL CYCLE AND VIRAL
REPLICATION
The Ns genes of RSV are crucial for the replication and
proliferation of the virus in many ways. Prior studies suggest that
the Ns genes are required for a permissive infection in vivo but
are not required for a permissive infection in vitro, though these
viruses grow more slowly (Teng and Collins, 1999; Jin et al., 2000;
Bossert and Conzelmann, 2002). However, some researchers have
found that while Ns1 deletion strongly attenuates the in vivo
infection, the gene is not strictly required for permissive infection
(Teng et al., 2000).

RSV NS Proteins Functions
Additionally, Ns1 and Ns2 are capable of inhibiting premature
apoptosis, which protects the virus’s cellular resources allowing
it to continue replicating. Several RSV proteins, including the
Ns proteins, have been shown to block or delay apoptotic death
of infected cells (Bitko et al., 2007). The mechanism behind
this may be IFN independent as observed in A549 and Vero
cell, perhaps through inducing the expression of anti-apoptotic
factors like AKT (Barik, 2013; Sun and Lopez, 2017). Both Ns1
and Ns2 induce the production of anti-apoptotic molecules early
in infection such as NF-κB, AKT, PDK, and GSK. Other viruses
such as PIV5 (which is related to RSV) also use some of their
proteins to inhibit apoptosis, indicating that this behavior may
be typical in RNA viral IFN-antagonists (Barik, 2013). Ns1 is
involved in modulating the cell cycle of the infected cell and
is thought to be a key player during the G1-phase arrest. RSV
infected cells, in general, seem to have a G0/G1-phase preference
(Barik, 2013).
CONCLUSION
The Ns genes serve an essential purpose in the lifecycle of
RSV and have far-reaching implications for symptomology and
pathology of the virus. They are capable of aﬀecting almost
every stage of the immune response and have multiple ways of
eﬀecting the same systems. From inhibiting both the primary
and secondary waves of interferon production via TLR, RIGI, and STAT pathways to altering immune cell maturation
and diﬀerentiation, the Ns proteins prove crucial in blocking
the immune response and protecting RSV from the antiviral
response. Some of their features and functions outlined in this
review are summarized in Figure 2.
Despite their crucial function of immune suppression, they
are still considered to be unessential accessory proteins, which
can be deleted in vitro with little eﬀect of viral replication as
a whole. In-vivo they may serve as possible vaccine deletion

RSV NS Proteins Functions
mutants or treatment targets as their deletion serves to attenuate
the virus. They may also serve a purpose in suppressing
anti-inﬂammatory treatments as Ns1 suppresses glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) nuclear translocation and may block it completely
(Xie et al., 2017). Ns1 interacts with IPO13 (importin) and may
compete with GR for IPO13 binding, providing a mechanism
of suppression or blockage. The lack of GR translocation may
explain why RSV infection seems to lead to glucocorticoid
insensitivity (Xie et al., 2017).
RSV infection in infants and the elderly are known to cause
signiﬁcant inﬂammation in the lungs, especially in the lower
respiratory tract. Experiments in aged mice and cotton rats
show that aged animals have a delayed viral clearance with
reduced IFN-γ levels, as also observed in infants (Lee et al., 2005;
Boukhvalova et al., 2007; Fulton and Varga, 2009; Verhoeven,
2019). IFN-γ is a signiﬁcant factor in RSV clearance and is
secreted by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Gonzalez et al., 2012).
Moreover, Ns1 can alter CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and reduces
the amount of IFN-γ produced by dendritic cells (Munir et al.,
2011). Other sources of inﬂammation in RSV infection include
the upregulation of TNF-α production through TLR activation
and enhanced recruitment of neutrophils (Abu-Harb et al., 1999;
McNamara et al., 2005; Rudd et al., 2005; Dou et al., 2013). While
neutrophils are readily detected in infected airways CD8+ and
CD4+ T cells needed to clear infection are often only detected
at low levels (Rosenberg and Domachowske, 2012). Neutrophils
recruitment by Il-8 is increased during RSV infection and can
increase inﬂammation further damaging to the lung epithelia
(Abu-Harb et al., 1999; McNamara et al., 2005). Neutrophils can
be infected by RSV, and there is some evidence that RSV infection
of neutrophils may inhibit their phagocytic ability (O’Donnell
et al., 1998; Rohwedder et al., 1998; Torres et al., 2010; Halfhide
et al., 2011; Verhoeven et al., 2014). It is unknown how this may
be occurring, but it would not be surprising if the NS genes
were involved in some way due to their ability to aﬀect other
immune cells.
The Ns proteins traﬃc to the mitochondria and are
sequestered there but is unknown what they are doing while
there. Perhaps they are further tweaking gene regulation. How
and why the Ns genes speciﬁcally alter the expression and ratios
of T helper and other immune cells also needs to be determined.
While Ns1 inhibits replication in minigenome systems, it has not
been shown to inhibit replication in other systems. Since Ns1
traﬃcs to the nucleus, it may be inhibiting cellular transcription
or replication there. The M and Ns1 proteins are closely
associated, and M traﬃcs to the nucleus where it inhibits cellar
transcription, but these interactions in the nucleus need further
study. More research needs to be done on the mechanisms of
action of the Ns genes as their inhibitory eﬀects on the immune
system contribute to the severe symptomology associated with
RSV infection. The timing of Ns function during in infection
is not well-understood, and there is evidence that both genes
may be modiﬁed and are inherently unstable with some reports
showing loss of protein after 30 min (Huang et al., 1985; Collins
et al., 1996; Evans et al., 1996). There is even some evidence
that Ns2 maybe secreted which would allow for easier treatment
targeting, or as an addition to a subunit vaccine strategy to
limit overstimulation by the immune system (Collins et al.,
1996).
Currently there are vaccine candidates under investigation
that have Ns2 deletions, deletion of the Ns genes are attenuating
with deletion on Ns1 having a greater eﬀect than deletion of
Ns2 and deletion of both is considered to be over attenuating.
While promising both vaccine candidates combine other viral
alterations with the Ns2 deletion indicating that Ns2 deletion
alone may be under attenuating. A viable vaccine candidate for
RSV that involves the deletion or modiﬁcation of the Ns genes
must be careful to strike the balance between over and under
attenuation of the virus, which may be diﬃcult given the lack of
knowledge of the Ns genes (Jin et al., 2000; Bitko et al., 2007;
Munir et al., 2008; Luongo et al., 2013; Karron et al., 2019).
Through further study of the Ns genes and their activity in cells,
we can better understand RSV and ﬁnd novel therapies and
vaccine strategies to better combat RSV in the future, especially
given how common this virus is.

Background:
Selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(SSRIs)
are
the
ﬁrst-line
pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but a large proportion
of patients do not achieve remission after an adequate SSRI trial. To the best
of our knowledge, there have been no well-powered randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of sequenced pharmacotherapy using pragmatic research designs. China
provides a unique context for undertaking such a trial that will recruit the largest
treatment-naïve participants and systematically compare the efﬁcacy of different
sequenced pharmacotherapy.
Methods: A pragmatic research design will be adopted, with n = 1,600 treatmentnaïve OCD patients initially treated for sertraline for 12 weeks, and with non-remitters
then randomized to 5 different augmentation or switching pharmacotherapy options for
another 12 weeks. The 5 arms will include: (1) treatment with higher than usual doses
of sertraline, (2) switch to ﬂuvoxamine, (3) switch to venlafaxine, (4) augmentation with
memantine, and (5) augmentation with aripiprazole.
Discussion:
China is uniquely positioned to recruit sufﬁciently large sample sizes
of treatment-naïve OCD patients to compare different pharmacotherapy options; data
from the proposed trial promises to help inform current clinical practice guidelines by
providing important information about optimal pharmacotherapy choice for those who
demonstrate no response or response but no remission to ﬁrst line pharmacotherapy.

Pragmatic Trial of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
Trial Registration:
The trail was registered on 27 August 2020 in ClinicalTrials.gov
(https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/) (NCT04539951).
Keywords: obsessive-compulsive disorder, treatment-naïve, pharmacotherapy, alternatives, remission
INTRODUCTION
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common and
disabling disorder that has a 12-month and lifetime prevalence
of 1–3% worldwide, and that is accompanied by signiﬁcant
morbidity, impairment and huge economic burden (1–4). OCD
is characterized by obsessions and compulsions; obsessions
are comprised of unwanted, intrusive and persistent thoughts
and images, while compulsions are comprised of repetitive
behaviors, often executed with the purpose of relieving anxiety
and distress caused by obsessions (5). There is a strong evidencebase demonstrating the eﬃcacy and tolerability of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in OCD, and these agents
are therefore viewed as a ﬁrst-line pharmacotherapy in OCD
treatment guidelines (6–9).
Nevertheless, a large proportion of OCD patients are response
only partially or not at all to an adequate trial of an SSRI
(10–12). The literature on randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
of pharmacotherapy approaches to OCD when response to an
SSRI is unsatisfactory is relatively sparse, with little attention
to pragmatic or “real-world” research designs, or to those who
respond but do not remit to treatment. Pragmatic trials are
important for obtaining data on representative samples (13),
while remission entails improvements in both symptoms and
function and so is an important goal for patients (14–16).
On the basis of the existing sparse literature, several
pharmacotherapy options for OCD patients who do not respond,
or who respond but do not remit, have been outlined in current
treatment guidelines. These include (1) treatment with higher
than usual doses of an SSRI, (2) switch to a diﬀerent SSRI, (3)
switch to a diﬀerent class of medication, (4) augmentation with
a dopamine blocker, and (5) augmentation with a glutamatergic
agent. There is a need for additional data, particularly real-world
data, on how best to choose between these options.
China
provides
a
unique
context
for
undertaking
appropriately
powered
RCTs
to
compare
diﬀerent
pharmacotherapy options for those who do not remit following
an adequate SSRI initial trial. Our research will be able to recruit
the largest treatment-naïve sample in a clinical trial to date,
and such data may be extremely useful for informing evidencebased treatment guidelines on optimal pharmacotherapy of
treatment-naïve OCD. The proposed RCT will adopt a pragmatic
treatment design, recruiting OCD patients for a 12-week trial
of sertraline, and then randomizing non-remitters to 5 diﬀerent
treatment options.
METHODS
Design
This study is a multi-center clinical study with a total of 13 clinical
centers that specialize in the management of patients with OCD.
In the Chinese context, such centers evaluate and manage many
treatment-naïve patients. This allows such centers to undertake
well-powered pragmatic research trials.
A randomized block design will be used in this study and
all eligible participants accepted into this study will undergo an
initial course of pharmacotherapy (phase I), and non-remitters
will be randomly allocated to ﬁve treatment arms (phase II). In
phase II, the 5 arms will comprise (1) treatment with higher
than usual doses of sertraline, (2) switch to ﬂuvoxamine, (3)
switch to venlafaxine, (4) augmentation with memantine, and (5)
augmentation with aripiprazole. Physician and patients will know
which treatment arm is employed, but change in OCD symptoms
will be assessed at several diﬀerent time points by independent
evaluators (IEs) who will be blind to treatment assignment. The
ﬂow diagram of the study protocol is shown in Figure 1.
Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria
Participants will be recruited from Shanghai Mental Health
Center and twelve other specialized OCD sites in China.
Individuals will be included in the study if they (1) meet
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, ﬁfth
Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OCD as the primary diagnosis (17);
(2) are in the age range from 18 to 65 years; (3) have a score of
at least 20 on Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)
(18); (4) have never received medication for OCD, and have not
received any form of psychotherapy for OCD in the past 6 month;
(5) have provided written informed consent.
Participants will be excluded if they (1) have met the DSM5 diagnostic criteria for Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders, or the Bipolar and Related Disorders;
(2) have a moderate or higher risk of suicide (?9 on the
Suicide Module in the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI) (19); (3) have substance use that is suﬃciently
severe to possibly impact negatively on treatment adherence
in the past 1 year; (4) have severe depression with Beck
Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score of ≥29 (20); (5) have
comorbid psychiatric or medical disorders that may impact
negatively on adherence to or on the eﬃcacy of medication (e.g.,
borderline personality disorder, CNS disorders); (6)are pregnant
or lactating females.
Screening and Baseline Visit
All recruited patients will be diagnosed as having OCD as
the primary diagnosis by a psychiatrist, using DSM-5 criteria.
The Y-BOCS (18) will be used to assess the severity of
OC symptoms, and the MINI (19) will be used to screen
history of comorbid DSM-5 psychiatric disorders. At baseline,
demographic data (including age, gender and education) will
be collected, and participants will undergo a brief physical
examination including blood routine and liver function tests.
In addition, participants will complete the self-administered

Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Revised (OCI-R) (21), BDI-II,
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (22) and Sheehan Disability Scale
(SDS) (23) to measure the severity of clinical symptoms. The
Chinese versions of all measures have been proved to be reliable
and eligible (24–27).
Interventions
Experimental Phase I: Initial Treatment
The protocol will be approved by the Institutional Review Board
of all participating centers. All recruited participants will provide
written informed consent before any study procedures are
undertaken. Participants will be made fully aware of the design
of the study, and of possible adverse eﬀects of the medications
under investigation.
Sertraline was chosen to represent the SSRIs as the initial
treatment. The rationale for this chosen is as following: First,
sertraline is one of four SSRIs approved by the National Medical
Products Administration (NMPA) for the treatment of OCD in
China, and is recommended as ﬁrst-line agent by the Chinese
Practice Guideline on OCD (9). Second, in terms of drug
metabolism, sertraline demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics
when daily dose is between 50 and 200 mg (28), so it is
Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org

Wang et al.
Pragmatic Trial of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
straightforward for physicians to adjust the dose according to the
patient’s condition. Third, there is good evidence of the safety
and tolerability of sertraline, and this medication has few drug
interactions. In addition, sertraline is considered the medication
treatment of choice for OCD in the clinical practice in China.
In phase I, participants will receive sertraline, initially at 50
mg/d, with a weekly 50 mg/d further increase, to the maximum
recommended dosage (200 mg/d) or to the maximum tolerated
dosage (<200 mg/d). Patients will be on their maximum dose by
week 4, so allowing an assessment of response at 12 weeks (29).
• If the patients achieved remission in the ﬁrst-step treatment
[scores of ≤12 on the Y-BOCS and Clinical Global Impression
–Severity (CGI-S) rating of 1 or 2 at week 12], participants will
be continued on sertraline for another 12 weeks (30).
• Participants who do not achieve remission in the ﬁrst-step
treatment (scores of >12 on the Y-BOCS or CGI-S ≥3) will
be randomly assigned to the second-step treatment. However,
participants who do not achieve remission because they cannot
tolerate a high dose of sertraline (200 mg) will not enter the
second phase.
Experimental Phase II: Sequenced Treatment
Alternatives
The
second-step
therapy
will
consist
of
ﬁve
treatment
options
including
higher-than-usual-maximal
dosage
of
sertraline, switching to ﬂuvoxamine, switching to venlafaxine,
augmentation
with
memantine,
and
augmentation
with
aripiprazole.
The
rationale
for
each
of
these
treatment
options follows.
• Higher-than-usual-maximal dosage of sertraline: Previous
evidence from a meta-analysis of OCD pharmacotherapy
suggested that higher doses of SSRI may allow a more optimal
response with similar adverse eﬀects, when compared with
lower doses of SSRI (31). Furthermore, a multicenter doubleblind randomized controlled trial revealed that a higher-thanusual dose of sertraline (250–400 mg/d) was more eﬃcacious
than a standard dose (200 mg/d), but with similar tolerability
(32). In view of this literature, but also considering the
precautionary principle, we set an intermediate dose (300
mg/d) as the upper limit.
• Switching to ﬂuvoxamine: Research suggests that diﬀerent
SSRIs may have equal eﬃcacy in OCD, but treatment
guidelines note that diﬀerent SSRIs may have slightly diﬀerent
pharmacological proﬁles and suggest that some patients
who do not responds to a particular SSRI may respond
to a diﬀerent one (33). There is good evidence for the
eﬃcacy of ﬂuvoxamine in OCD. In addition, ﬂuvoxamine is
considered the second medication treatment choice for OCD
in China (34).
• Switching
to
venlafaxine:
Although
venlafaxine
is
not
considered a ﬁrst-line agent for OCD, this serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) has a diﬀerent
pharmacological mechanism from the SSRIs, and so is
recommended for patients who do not remit after treatment
with an SSRI in a number of practice guidelines (6, 8). A
randomized double-blind study also showed that venlafaxine
(300 mg/d) was equally eﬀective to paroxetine (60 mg/d) in
treating patients with OCD (35). A real-world research also
suggested that venlafaxine may be useful in a proportion of
patients with poor response to SSRIs (36). In addition, the
maximum dose of venlafaxine approved for clinical practice
in China is 300 mg/d. So, we set the target dose at 300 mg/d
although the recommendation for venlafaxine is 350 mg/d in
some countries.
• Augmentation with memantine or aripiprazole: Augment
treatment strategies have widely been recommended and
studied in patients who have not had an adequate response
to SSRIs. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and openlabel data have both demonstrated that SSRI augmentation
with memantine, a glutamatergic agent, is superior to placebo
in OCD (37, 38). Similarly, RCTs and open-label data have
demonstrated that SSRI augmentation with aripiprazole, an
atypical antipsychotic, is eﬃcacious in OCD (39). There
is some evidence that aripiprazole has a superior eﬃcacy
and tolerability proﬁle compared to other antipsychotic
agents when used to augment SSRIs in OCD (39). Thus, a
number of practice guidelines suggest that SSRI augmentation
with memantine and aripiprazole may be considered in the
management of OCD (6, 8, 40).
In summary, during phase II, the treatment options will be:
• Remain on sertraline (higher dosage): where sertraline 200 mg
has been tolerated, dosage will be increased by 50 mg
fortnightly to a maximal dose of 300 mg/d or to the maximum
tolerable dose (<300 mg/d).
• Switch to ﬂuvoxamine: ﬂuvoxamine will be initiated at
a dose of 50 mg/d, increasing quickly to a maximal
dose of 300 mg/d or the maximum tolerated dose by
week 4 (41).
• Switch to venlafaxine: venlafaxine will be initiated at 75 mg/d,
increasingly weekly by 75 mg/day, to a maximal dose of 300
mg/d or the maximum tolerated dose (35).
• Augment with memantine: sertraline will be augmented with
memantine initially at 5 mg/d, and increasing by 5 mg/d
weekly to a maximal dose of 20 mg/d (10 mg twice daily) or
the maximum tolerated dose (42).
• Augment with aripiprazole: sertraline will be augmented with
aripiprazole, initially at 5 mg/d, and increasing by 5 mg/d
weekly to a maximal dose of 20 mg/d or the maximum
tolerated dose (43).
At the conclusion of phase II at week 24, physician may
choose to continue the current treatment regime, or to make
appropriate changes, as per the principles of the Chinese Practice
Guideline on OCD (which are similar to those of other practice
guidelines from around the world) (6–9). The extended follow up
assessment will last up to the month 12 after baseline (i.e., week
25-week 52) if participants are willing to stay in the program.
Adjuvant
therapy
with
benzodiazepines
or
nonbenzodiazepines for insomnia will be allowed during the
course of the study, but other psychotropic agents will not be

permitted. Participants can withdraw from the study at any time
if they wish to do so, without any consequences.
Sample Size
To determine the detectable eﬀect size, sequential multipleassignment randomized clinical trials (SMART) were used
to verify the design of pharmacotherapy options following
unsatisfactory initial treatment in OCD. Given preliminary data
and literature retrieval, an expected remission rate to Y-BOCS
(phase I) (44). In phase II, there are 5 groups. Through multiple
comparisons, the clinical remission rate of the two groups with
the smallest diﬀerence was evaluated, P_T = 20%, P_C = 10%.
We use the type I error at 0.05 (α = 0.05), type II error at 0.2
(β = 0.2) and get a sample size of 199 in each group [total
sample size is 199∗5/(1–20%) = 1,244] using PASS software
version V11. Consider a 20% drop-out rate, the minimum sample
size of N = 1,600 for Phase I was calculated according to the
possible combination.
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome will be OCD symptoms severity as
measured by the Y-BOCS (18) and by IEs. The Y-BOCS has
been shown to have good psychometric properties, is sensitive for
measuring treatment eﬀects, and is regarded as the gold standard
for symptom severity assessment in trials of OCD.
Secondary Outcome
The secondary outcomes will comprise clinical severity (anxiety,
depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms), functional
impairment and side eﬀects at diﬀerent time, as assessed with the
following measures:
Clinical Global Impression
The Clinical Global Impression (CGI; National Institute of
Mental Health) (45) is a clinician-rated scale to assess treatment
response in patients with mental disorders. It requires the
clinician to rate how much the patient’s illness has improved or
worsened relative to a baseline measurement (phase I: week 0;
phase II: week 12).
Beck Anxiety Inventory
The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (22) is a 21-item, self-report
inventory which identiﬁes anxiety symptoms and quantiﬁes their
intensity. Respondents are asked to rate how much they have
been bothered by each item over the past week.
Beck Depression Inventory-II
The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) (46) is a 21-item, selfreport rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and
symptoms of depression. It includes both cognitive and somatic
symptoms of depression.
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised
The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Revised (OCI-R) (21) is a
18-item self-report measure of obsessive-compulsive measures.
It is chosen because of its psychometric properties and the short
time that its administration requires.
Sheehan Disability Scale
Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) (23) is a reliable, brief self-report
scale that assesses disability or functional impairment on 3 items:
work, social life and family life.
Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale
The Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) (47) is widely
used to record side eﬀects. We will use it to assess tolerability of
the diﬀerent treatment arms.
Tolerability
The tolerability of treatment will be deﬁned as side eﬀect
discontinuation in this study. as deﬁned by the proportion
of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events
during the study (48).
Medication Management
Screening visit will include Informed consent, demographic data,
MINI Psychiatric Interview, symptom measures. All the recruited
participants of this study are interviewed and evaluated by IEs
who are blind to randomization every two or four weeks after
enrollment and following-up evaluation will be up to week 24.
If participants are willing, we will continue to extend follow up
interview for up to 12 months after baseline (week 25-week 52).
Details are provided below (Table 1).
1. Interview 1 (week 0): veriﬁcation of inclusion/exclusion
criteria, assessment of insight, symptom measures, laboratory
investigation (e.g., electrocardiogram, blood testing, and other
necessary tests).
2. Interviews 2–8 (week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24): follow up
with symptoms measures, laboratory investigation, recording
adverse events, ending record.
3. Extended interview (up to 12 months after week 0): follow
up with symptom measures, laboratory inspection, recording
adverse events.
All participants will complete the self-reports mentioned
above and will be administered the clinician-rated scales either
face-to-face or via telephone or by remote video conferencing.
Adherence
To increase adherence to pharmacotherapy, the clinician treating
the patient will emphasize the importance of continuous
administration of medication at each visit. In addition, all
participants will be asked to record their daily medication intake
in standard forms. Drug dosage reduction, increase or missing
administration will be recorded. From all records the participants
will be divided into three categories: good compliance, deﬁned as
medication taken as intended; moderate compliance, deﬁned as
reduced medication to one to two tablets per day for a maximum
of 4 weeks and/or no tablets for a maximum 2 weeks as projected;
and poor compliance, deﬁned as reduced medication to one to
two tablets per day more than 4 weeks and/or no tablets more
than 2 weeks.
Safety and Monitoring
The TESS will be used by the clinician treating the patients to
evaluate side eﬀects at each visit following initiation of treatment.

Adverse and secondary events will be recorded from the baseline
visit and throughout the follow-up visits. All adverse events will
be report to the administration agency of the hospital. Serious
adverse events will be reported to the Ethics Committee at each
site and to the lead site. The association of an event with study
drugs will be evaluated based on a temporal and biological
correlation analyses.
Data Collection and Management
Participants in this study will be interviewed and evaluated by
IEs in the study, and the data will be directly collected using the
electronic data management system.
• Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF): Data administrators will
build eCRFs according to the research protocol.
• Permission Assignment: Data administrators will create
accounts and grant diﬀerent permissions to access the system
according to diﬀerent identities of researcher, rater and
inspector. For example, researchers of each center will only be
able to browse and modify the data they collect themselves.
The case situation at each center will be read by the supervisor,
who has no authority to modify the data, but who can
comment or raise questions.
• Data input: Clinical researchers or coordinators will promptly
and accurately enter the data into the eCRF.
• Data Questions and Answers: For the questions in the case
report, the independent supervisor will issue the Q&A form,
and the researcher or evaluator should answer and return it as
soon as possible. The data administrator will modify the data
according to the answers of the researcher and may issue the
Q&A form again if necessary.
• Data Locking and Exporting: After each participant completes
the experiment and is veriﬁed by the supervisor, the data
manager will lock the data. During the experiment, real-time
lock data was exported for interim analysis as required. After
all the test data were locked, the data manager will export them
to the designated database for ﬁnal statistical analysis.
Statistical Methods
Descriptive analysis and statistics will be undertaken with SPSS
20.0. All the relevant data of patients meeting the inclusion
criteria will be used as the data set for analysis. Comparison
among the clinical and demographic characteristics of the
samples will conducted by chi-square test and t-test. The patient’s
adherence to treatment and the factors aﬀecting prognosis will be
classiﬁed and counted by SPSS combined with R. Ordinal multicategorical logistic regression model will be used to construct the
index system of symptom severity. Mixed-eﬀect models will be
used to evaluate the eﬃcacy of treatment on both the primary
treatment outcome measure (the YBOCS) as well as on secondary
treatment outcome measures.
Informed Consent
The researcher needs to explain in detail the purpose of
this study, research contents, the potential risk and beneﬁt,
alternative therapies available and the rights and obligations
of the participants in line with the Helsinki Declaration to all
screening participants (compulsive disorder patients willing to
participate in the study). The medical treatment of patients who
do not agree to enter the study will not be impacted. Participants
have the right to withdraw at any stage after they enter the study.
The explanation should also include the necessary matters to
protect the individual rights and interests of the participants.
With full explanation, after conﬁrming that the patient fully
understands the study and clearly knows the informed consent,
the participant can enter the research process only by signing the
informed consent and indicating the date.

Pragmatic Trial of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
If the informed consent is revised during the study, the
modiﬁed content of the informed consent shall have an impact
on the patients out of the group after the end of the study, and
patients undergoing treatment or follow-up shall sign the newly
revised informed consent again.
Quality Control
Research coordinator of each research center is responsible for
the coordination in the research, and the implementation of
the project schedule management. The independent supervisor
will monitor the quality of the work by reviewing informed
consents, and completion of eCRFs. They will visit site every
6 months. 25% of all cases are randomly selected for checking
by the independent monitor. In addition, all sites will submit
a brief description of the clinical features of their patients
at time of recruitment to monitor accuracy of diagnosis (for
example, excluding patients with body dysmorphic disorder). In
addition, all IEs will receive online training in administration
of the YBOCS and CGI. The training process will comprise
introductory lectures and demonstrations by experienced raters,
followed by repeated rating of videos until such time as inter-rater
reliability is obtained. To maintain reliability of ratings, raters
will receive additional training up to four times per year and
inter-rater reliability will be assessed.
DISCUSSION
The current clinical trial is being conducted to compare
diﬀerent approaches to the pharmacological treatment of OCD
patients who do not respond, or who respond but do not
remit, to ﬁrst line SSRI pharmacotherapy. To the best of our
knowledge, this will be the ﬁrst study to compare the eﬃcacy
of several switching or augment strategies for medications
in such patients, and the largest prospective randomized
pragmatic trial of OCD to date. Our hope is that this study
will provide useful evidence to inform clinical practice and
international guidelines on the pharmacological management
of OCD.
There are several unique features of this study. First, the
design is pragmatic in several respects, for example, patients with
secondary major depression will be included, and physicians and
patients will not be double-blind to treatment. Second, the design
is rigorous, with randomization to diﬀerent treatment arms,
and with raters being kept blind to treatment randomization in
Phase II. Third, the trial will compare several augmentation and
switching strategies. Finally, this will be the largest RCT of OCD
ever conducted to date.
In conclusion, this pragmatic study is the ﬁrst randomized
trial that compares 5 diﬀerent pharmacotherapy options in
patients who do not have remission after treatment with an
SSRI, and it should provide data that are useful in informing
the optimal pharmacotherapeutic approach to such patients. It
hopes to complement the existing literature on large pragmatic
trials of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression,
by contributing equally informative data on OCD.
TRIAL STATUS
This trial is recruiting and is expected to be complete in
December 2024.

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder affecting 
1%–3% of the population worldwide. About half of OCD afflicted individuals do not 
respond to currently available pharmacotherapy, which is mainly based on serotonin 
reuptake inhibition. Therefore, there is a critical need to search novel and improved 
therapeutic targets to treat this devastating disorder. In recent years, accumulating 
evidence has supported the glutamatergic hypothesis of OCD, and particularly pointing a 
potential role for the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3. This mini-review summarizes 
recent findings regarding the neurobiological basis of OCD, with an emphasis on the 
glutamatergic neurotransmission and EAAT3 as a key player in OCD etiology.

OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder affecting 1%–3% of the population 
worldwide (Grabe et al., 2000; Angst et al., 2004). It is characterized by recurrent, intrusive worries, 
feelings or unwanted thoughts (obsessions), and repetitive, structured, ritualistic mental acts and/or 
behaviors (compulsions). OCD is clinically heterogeneous, displaying a wide range of symptomatic 
expression (Murphy et al., 2013). Most OCD patients also have high levels of anxiety, likely due to 
the inability to control or stop the appearance of obsessions (Pauls et al., 2014). Both obsessions 
and compulsions are time consuming, causing a high impairment in social and occupational areas 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Current OCD treatment involves cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or combined with 
pharmacotherapy mainly based on serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI), such as fluoxetine, 
clomipramine or paroxetine (Bouvard et al., 2004; Cottraux et al., 2005; Skapinakis et al., 2016). 
However, only about half of patients achieve an adequate decrease in the severity of symptoms 
(Hirschtritt et al., 2017), highlighting the need for new therapeutic options to treat this devastating 
disorder.
CORTICO-STRIATO-THALAMO-CORTICAL LOOP 
MODIFICATIONS IN OCD
Since original reports, neuroimaging studies have consistently indicated that a dysfunction in 
the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loop is involved in OCD (Milad and Rauch, 2012; 
Nakao et al., 2014; Burguiere et al., 2015). In a brief and oversimplified manner, the CSTC loop

is composed of glutamatergic pyramidal cortical neurons that 
project onto striatal subnuclei. From here, GABAergic neurons 
project to basal ganglia and the thalamus throughout both direct 
and indirect pathways; in turn, the thalamus sends recurrent 
projections back to cortical areas (Alexander and Crutcher, 
1990). A normal CSTC loop function is required for regulating 
habitual and goal-directed behaviors (Gerfen and Surmeier, 
2011). Neuroimaging studies, for example, indicated changes in 
the volume of the anterior cingulate cortex and the thalamus in 
OCD patients compared to healthy controls (Atmaca et al., 2007; 
Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2009), an alteration that was shown to 
be restored in responders to SRI treatment (Atmaca et al., 2006). 
At the functional level, hyperactivity of the anterior cingulate, 
orbitofrontal cortex, and caudate (Saxena et al., 2001; Maia et al., 
2008), as well as altered functional connectivity between the 
medial frontal cortex and striatal regions have been reported in 
OCD (Fitzgerald et al., 2011; Posner et al., 2014).
GLUTAMATE SYSTEM DYSFUNCTIONS IN 
THE PATHOGENESIS OF OCD
Multiple neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the 
etiology of OCD. Since clinically efficacious pharmacotherapy 
targets the serotonin system, impairments in this neurotransmitter 
were hypothesized to be disease-causing (Insel et al., 1985; March 
et al., 1989; Barr et al., 1993) and probably explain certain aspects 
of OCD pathophysiology. However, like other neuropsychiatric 
entities, OCD is multifactorial and thereby additional hypotheses 
have been proposed (Pauls et al., 2014). For instance, some SRIrefractory OCD patients can benefit from combined therapy with 
antipsychotic drugs targeting dopamine D2 receptors (Dold et al., 
2013; Dold et al., 2015), consistent with changes in dopaminergic 
system reported in OCD patients (Denys et al., 2004), including 
a decrease in dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopamine D2 
receptors levels in basal ganglia (Denys et al., 2004; Hesse et al., 
2005). Both monoamine hypotheses are supported by reports of 
OCD-like behaviors in animal models where modifications of 
serotonin or dopamine neurotransmitter systems were achieved 
by genetic or pharmacological intervention (Yadin et al., 1991; 
Szechtman et al., 1998; Chou-Green et al., 2003; Ralph-Williams 
et al., 2003).
Over the last decades, increasing lines of evidence support a 
glutamatergic hypothesis in OCD. For instance, multiple trials 
have reported promising results in OCD using glutamatetargeting drugs. Memantine, ketamine, and rapastinel, all 
drugs acting on glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDAR) have 
shown beneficial effects in OCD treatment (Bakhla et al., 
2013; Rodriguez et al., 2016; Modarresi et al., 2018). Moreover, 
Riluzole, a drug that reduces glutamate synaptic levels (by acting 
at both presynaptically and at glial glutamate transporters) has 
been shown to improve OCD symptomatology in about 50% of 
patients when given concomitantly with SRI (Coric et al., 2005; 
Grant et al., 2007; Pittenger et al., 2015). Other studies have 
shown that the adjunctive use of N-acetyl cysteine alleviates 
OCD symptomatology (Lafleur et al., 2006; Lalanne et al., 
2014; Ghanizadeh et al., 2017; di Michele et al., 2018). N-acetyl 
cysteine is a cysteine donor, precursor for glutathione (a potent 
antioxidant), and also increases glutamate levels by activating the 
glial glutamate/cysteine antiporter.
Alterations in fluid or imaging biomarkers of glutamatergic 
neurotransmission have been reported in OCD, including 
increased glutamate content in cerebrospinal fluid of OCD 
untreated patients (Chakrabarty et al., 2005) and a positive 
correlation between compulsive behavior and glutamate 
concentration in the anterior cingulate cortex (Naaijen et al., 
2017). Interestingly, a previous study performed in child and 
adolescent OCD patients reported decreased, rather than 
increased glutamate levels in this brain region (Rosenberg 
et  al., 2004). Higher glutamate concentration was also found 
in the caudate nucleus in child OCD patients that was restored 
after treatment with paroxetine (Rosenberg et al., 2000). Such 
alterations in the levels of glutamate in distinct nuclei of the CSTC 
loop might lead to (or reflect) functional changes that ultimately, 
lead to abnormal neuronal circuit activity. Consistent with this 
idea, three recently developed animal models of OCD display 
glutamatergic alterations in cortico-striatal synapses (Welch et al., 
2007; Shmelkov et al., 2010; Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019).
GENETICS OF GLUTAMATERGIC SYSTEM 
GENES IN OCD
Genetic studies also provide support for the glutamatergic 
hypothesis of OCD, including linkage and association studies. 
For instance, the 5072T/G variant of GRIN2B gene, which 
encodes for the NR2B subunit of NMDARs, was significantly 
associated with OCD in a family-based study (Arnold et al., 
2004), whereas the rs1019385 polymorphism was associated with 
reduced glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate in drug-free 
pediatric OCD patients. Variants in the GRIK2 gene encoding 
the kainate receptor subunit 2 have been also reported in OCD 
(Delorme et al., 2004; Sampaio et al., 2011). Another glutamaterelated gene proposed in OCD is DLGAP3, which encodes for 
the postsynaptic scaffolding protein SAPAP3 implicated in the 
anchoring of glutamate receptors. As discussed below, SAPAP3 
knock-out (KO) mice display OCD relevant behaviors (Welch 
et al., 2007). These findings prompted genetic studies where 
some DLGAP3 gene variants were found to be more associated 
with grooming disorders than with OCD (Bienvenu et al., 2009; 
Zuchner et al., 2009; Boardman et al., 2011).
Genetic studies have also suggested a role for the SLC1A1 
gene, encoding the neuronal glutamate transporter 3 (EAAT3) 
in OCD. This gene was originally proposed in two independent 
genome-wide linkage OCD studies (Hanna et al., 2002; Willour 
et al., 2004). Subsequent family-based association and casecontrol studies found SLC1A1 gene variants that are associated 
with OCD (Arnold et al., 2006; Dickel et al., 2006; Stewart et al., 
2007; Shugart et al., 2009; Wendland et al., 2009; Samuels et al., 
2011). In addition, an association between an SLC1A1 haplotype 
and the appearance of atypical antipsychotic-induced OCD 
symptoms has been also reported (Kwon et al., 2009), reinforcing 
the idea that modifications of SLC1A1 gene might underlie 
the generation of compulsive behavior. A recent study found

that some SLC1A1 variants are associated with white matter 
microstructure modifications in child and adolescent OCD 
patients (Gasso et al., 2015), suggesting that they might also 
underlie the anatomical alterations seen in OCD. Nevertheless, 
a meta-analysis study found just a weak association between 
the SLC1A1 variant rs301443 and OCD, while rs12682807 was 
modestly associated in male subjects (Stewart et al., 2013). The 
lack of stronger association might be attributed to inadequate 
sample size, distinct clinical subtypes of OCD and genetic/
phenotypic heterogeneity of the subjects (Stewart et al., 2013; 
Rajendram et al., 2017). Two genome-wide association studies 
reported no SLC1A1 variants reaching genome wide significance, 
potentially due to statistical power limitations given low sample 
size (Stewart et al., 2013; Mattheisen et al., 2015).
To date, three studies have addressed the impact of SLC1A1 
gene variants on EAAT3 expression/function. VeenstraVanderWeele and colleagues characterized the rare SLC1A1 
coding variant T164A found in an OCD family, which was shown 
to have modest effects on both EAAT3 Vmax and Km parameters, 
suggesting a decrease in the number of EAAT3 available and 
its affinity for glutamate, respectively, which might be involved 
in the disorder (Veenstra-VanderWeele et al., 2012). However, 
no protein quantification was carried out in this work. In a 
second study, Bailey and colleagues characterized the EAAT3 
loss-of-function variants R445W and I395del found in human 
dicarboxylic aminoaciduria; both mutants dramatically reduced 
or abolished glutamate and cysteine transport by EAAT3 and led 
to almost absent EAAT3 surface expression in a cell line model 
(Rodenas-Ruano et al., 2012). Although no psychiatric assessment 
was available for the subjects in this study, authors reported that 
one of the patients carrying R445W variants exhibited features 
consistent with a diagnosis of OCD (Bailey et al., 2011). In a 
third study, Wendland and colleagues described SLC1A1 variants 
that affect mRNA expression in human dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex tissue and that were associated with OCD in a large casecontrol study (Wendland et al., 2009). Collectively, these data 
suggest that gene variants impacting EAAT3 expression might 
underlie the pathogenesis of OCD. A more definitive answer will 
hopefully be provided in the near future through adequatelypowered, large genome-wide association or sequencing studies 
that can yield statistically robust insights into the role of SLC1A1 
and other glutamatergic system genes in OCD.
THE NEURONAL GLUTAMATE 
TRANSPORTER EAAT3
EAAT3 belongs to the excitatory amino acid transporters family 
(EAAT1-5) that regulates the extracellular levels of glutamate. 
Although its expression is approximately 100-fold lower than 
other EAAT in brain (Holmseth et al., 2012), enriched EAAT3 
content is found in CSTC loop, including the cerebral cortex, 
hippocampus, striatum, and basal ganglia (Rothstein et al., 1994; 
Furuta et al., 1997; Shashidharan et al., 1997; Kanai and Hediger, 
2004; Holmseth et al., 2012), in glutamatergic, GABAergic, 
and dopaminergic neurons (Coco et al., 1997; Conti et al., 
1998; Sidiropoulou et al., 2001; Underhill et al., 2014). EAAT3 
is localized peri-synaptically on the postsynaptic spine (Coco 
et al., 1997; He et al., 2000), and several studies have indicated 
that its contribution to the overall glutamate uptake is much 
lesser compared to that of the astrocytic transporters EAAT1 and 
EAAT2 (Tong and Jahr, 1994; Rothstein et al., 1996; Diamond 
and Jahr, 1997; Tanaka et al., 1997). Nonetheless, increasing 
evidence indicate that EAAT3 contributes to buffer glutamate 
released during synaptic events and prolong the time course 
of astrocytic clearance in the hippocampus (Scimemi et al., 
2009), and to regulate the responses of extra-synaptic glutamate 
NMDA and AMPA receptors (Scimemi et al., 2009; Jarzylo and 
Man, 2012; Underhill et al., 2014; Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019) 
as well as metabotropic glutamate receptors (Otis et al., 2004; 
Wadiche and Jahr, 2005). As changes in EAAT3 activity can 
modify the trafficking of AMPARs and function of NMDARs, it 
is not surprising that EAAT3 has been shown to be involved in 
excitatory synaptic plasticity (Cao et al., 2014; Bjorn-Yoshimoto 
and Underhill, 2016; Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019). EAAT3 
can also control neuronal activity through a negative feedback 
of excitatory neurotransmission by regulating the synthesis of 
GABA at inhibitory terminals (Sepkuty et al., 2002; Mathews and 
Diamond, 2003) and by regulating the expression of D1 dopamine 
receptors (Bellini et al., 2018). Collectively, the evidence strongly 
supports the notion that EAAT3 regulates glutamate levels in the 
synaptic cleft and thus the function of postsynaptic receptors. 
Therefore, changes in EAAT3 expression and/or function at 
glutamatergic synapses within the CSTC loop might underlie the 
neurobiological basis of OCD.
EAAT3 has been also suggested to play a role on the neuronal 
redox balance as they also transport cysteine, the rate limiting 
substrate for glutathione synthesis (Himi et al., 2003; Aoyama et al., 
2006; Watabe et al., 2007). Indeed, EAAT3 KO mice have reduced 
glutathione brain levels, which correlates with the brain atrophy and 
hippocampal neurodegeneration in aged mice and impaired spatial 
memory reported in these mice (Aoyama et al., 2006; Berman 
et al., 2011). Increased oxidative stress and a reduced number 
of dopaminergic neurons were also found in EAAT3 KO mice 
(Berman et al., 2011). Correspondingly, mice lacking GTRAP3-18, a 
reticulum protein that interacts with and retains EAAT3 on cellular 
compartment (Lin et al., 2001) not only showed increased EAAT3 
levels at the plasma membrane, but also increased cysteine and 
glutathione brain content as well as improved performance in spatial 
memory tasks (Aoyama et al., 2012). In contrast, mice overexpressing 
EAAT3 have higher glutathione brain levels (Delgado-Acevedo 
et al., 2019), raising the possibility that alterations in redox balance 
might be also involved in OCD.
IMPAIRED GLUTAMATERGIC 
NEUROTRANSMISSION IN OCD ANIMAL 
MODELS
Three different genetic models, namely, the Sapap3 KO (Welch 
et al., 2007) mice, the Slitrk5 KO mice (Shmelkov et al., 2010), 
and the EAAT3 overexpressing mice (Delgado-Acevedo et al., 
2019), have been reported to recapitulate OCD hallmarks 
including cortico-striatal glutamatergic alterations, particularly

changes in NMDAR function, and displaying OCD-like 
behaviors that could be rescued by chronic administration 
of SSRI (See Table 1). Mice lacking SAPAP3 (a member of 
SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein family (SAPAPs)) exhibit 
an aberrantly increased self-grooming leading to skin 
wounds (Welch et al., 2007). SAPAP3 KO mice also showed 
increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field, zero-maze, 
and light-dark emergence tests; both increased anxiety and 
hyper-grooming behaviors were alleviated by fluoxetine 
administration for 6 days (Welch et al., 2007). SAPAP3 KO 
mice also show abnormalities at cortico-striatal synapses, 
including a decrease in AMPAR-mediated transmission 
and an increase in NMDAR-mediated transmission. Such 
alterations were specific for cortico-striatal synapses, as they 
were not observed in the hippocampus (Welch et al., 2007) 
neither in thalamo-striatal synapses (Wan et al., 2014) and 
were rescued by striatal injections of a lentivirus expressing 
SAPAP3 (Welch et al., 2007). While the reduction in AMPARmediated transmission is likely due to AMPAR endocytosis, 
an increased activity of mGluR5 receptors was also reported 
and might be involved in the increase of silent synapses (Wan 
et al., 2011). This increased mGluR5 activity seemed not only 
to accompany the OCD-like phenotype but could also be a 
causative agent, since acute mGluR5 activation recapitulated 
OCD-like behavior in wildtype mice, and mGluR5 antagonism 
reverted the phenotype on SAPAP3 KO mice (Ade et al., 2016). 
Additional dysregulation in serotonin and dopamine release 
and/or metabolism (Wood et al., 2018) as well as deficits in 
behavioral inhibition have been also reported in SAPAP3 
KO mice (Burguiere et al., 2013). While this evidence links 
SAPAP3 to compulsive behaviors, human DLGAP3/SAPAP3 
gene variants seem to be more related to disorders belonging 
to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum rather than directly to 
OCD, as discussed above (Bienvenu et al., 2009; Zuchner et al., 
2009; Boardman et al., 2011).
Similarly, the deletion of SlitrK5 gene was found to induce 
compulsive and anxiety-like behaviors in mice (Shmelkov et al., 
2010). The N-terminal region of SlitrK5, a transmembrane 
protein, is similar to Slit proteins conformed by two leucinerich domains, whereas the C-terminal is similar to Trk 
neurotrophin receptor (Aruga and Mikoshiba, 2003). Like 
SAPAP3 KO mice, increased self-grooming leading to skin 
lesions and facial hair loss has been reported in SlitrK5 KO 
mice (Shmelkov et al., 2010). They also display compulsivelike behavior in the marble burying test and increased anxietylike behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze tests, 
behavioral impairments that were restored by chronic (18 days) 
treatment with fluoxetine (Shmelkov et al., 2010). Importantly, 
SlitrK5 KO mice have selective over-activation of the 
orbitofrontal cortex and abnormalities in striatal glutamatergic 
signaling, including a reduction in the level of glutamate 
receptor subunits GluR1, GluR2, NR2A, and NR2B and a 
decrease in the amplitude of spikes in response to the corticostriatal stimulation (Shmelkov et al., 2010). While the exact 
mechanism by which Slitrk5 deletion impacts glutamatergic 
signaling remains unclear, Slitrk5 might play an important role 
in neuronal development as a rare synaptogenesis-impairing

Glutamate Transporter EAAT3 in OCD
Escobar et al.

mutation in the SLITRK5 gene has been recently associated 
with OCD (Song et al., 2017), suggesting that changes in 
the development and/or maturation of excitatory neurons 
in the CSTC circuit might underlie OCD pathophysiology. 
Consistent with this idea, SlitrK5 KO mice display decreased 
arbor complexity in striatal medium spiny neurons (Shmelkov 
et al., 2010), which might explain the decreased number of 
postsynaptic glutamate receptors and glutamatergic function, 
two hallmarks of OCD disorders.
Mouse models with altered EAAT3 expression have been 
useful to study OCD neurobiology. The first EAAT3 KO mouse 
model was reported in 1997 and indicated reduced spontaneous 
locomotor activity, but no other neurological dysfunctions nor 
OCD relevant behaviors (Peghini et al., 1997). Later, it was 
found that EAAT3 KO mice also display an age-dependent 
decrease of dopaminergic neurons number in the substantia 
nigra, which might explain the impaired locomotor activity 
(Berman et al., 2011). Similarly, changes in the volume of the 
hippocampal CA1 region, associated with an age-progressive 
decline in swim velocity and in spatial memory performance 
were also reported (Aoyama et al., 2006). Moreover, neurons 
from EAAT3 KO mice have been found to be more sensitive 
to oxidative stress (Aoyama et al., 2006), ischemia (Jang et al., 
2012; Choi et al., 2014), and traumatic brain injury (Choi et al., 
2016). Since some of the alterations in EAAT3 KO mice can 
be rescued by the treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (Berman 
et al., 2011), it is plausible to suggest that EAAT3 has a role 
in neuroprotection due to its cysteine donor function. In this 
context, increased oxidative status in OCD patients as well as a 
positive correlation between the severity of OCD symptoms and 
the level of lipid peroxidation have been reported (Chakraborty 
et al., 2009). Increased glutathione peroxidase levels in the 
plasma serum of treatment-naïve children with OCD (Simsek 
et al., 2016) and lower levels of glutathione in the posterior 
cingulate cortex have been also reported (Brennan et al., 2016). 
While animal and human studies indicate that SRIs can restore 
neuron oxidative status observed in mood disorders, to the best 
of our knowledge, only one study has suggested that fluoxetine 
treatment restores the oxidative status in OCD patients 
(Chakraborty et al., 2009).
After two decades of research since the first publication of 
an EAAT3 KO mouse model (Peghini et al., 1997), only one 
study has reported some behaviors reminiscent of compulsivelike behavior in EAAT3 KO mice (Bellini et al., 2018). A second 
EAAT3 KO mouse model was recently developed by a different 
research group and, in agreement with the majority of the studies, 
they found unaltered anxiety or compulsive-like behaviors in 
this model (Zike et al., 2017). Indeed, a decrease in grooming 
behavior and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, as well 
as in D1 dopamine receptor agonist-induced stereotypy (an 
effect correlated with reduced dopamine release in the striatum) 
was reported in this second EAAT3 KO model (Quinlan et al., 
1999). While genetic background (C57BL/6 vs CD1 strain) and/
or the age of the animals might explain some of the differences 
observed in the repetitive behavior in EAAT3 KO mouse, both 
studies highlight the impact of EAAT3 ablation on dopamine 
neurotransmission (Zike et al., 2017; Bellini et al., 2018). 
Altogether, these data suggest that OCD susceptibility might not 
be related to a reduced (or absent) EAAT3 expression/function. 
Consistent with this idea, one of the SLC1A1 gene variants highly 
replicated in OCD genetic studies is associated with increased 
rather than decreased EAAT3 mRNA levels in human brain tissue 
(Wendland et al., 2009). To explore this EAAT3 gain-of-function 
hypothesis, a conditional transgenic mouse line, in which 
EAAT3 was overexpressed under CamKIIα driver (EAAT3glo/
CMKII) was recently reported (Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019). 
This model exhibits increased anxiety and compulsive-like 
behaviors that were restored by chronic, but not acute, fluoxetine, 
or clomipramine treatment. Moreover, EAAT3glo/CMKII 
mice displayed alterations in the glutamatergic system in the 
striatum, including changes in NMDARs subunit composition 
(increased NR2B/NR2A ratio), and impaired NMDA-dependent 
synaptic plasticity (Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019). Interestingly, 
EAAT3glo/CMKII mice also displayed higher spontaneous 
recovery of fear memory, suggesting impairment in long-term 
extinction, which has also been described in OCD patients 
(Milad et al., 2013) and, to the best of our knowledge, for the first 
time in an OCD mouse model (Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019). In 
view of their high density in extinction-related brain areas, the 
NMDAR has been suggested to be a candidate for modulating 
extinction learning (for review see (Myers and Davis, 2002; 
Davis, 2011). However, whether changes in NMDAR subunits 
composition observed in the striatum of EAAT3glo/CMKII mice 
(Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019) also occur in extinction-related 
areas remain to be determined.
CONCLUSIONS
Converging 
evidence 
from 
genetic, 
neuroanatomical, 
pharmacological, and preclinical studies in both humans and 
animal models support that glutamate dysregulations may 
contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD. As discussed above, 
the findings from genetic mouse models that are relevant of OCD 
not only highlight glutamatergic alterations, and particularly 
altered NMDAR function in the OCD etiology, but also establish 
EAAT3 overexpression rather than an EAAT3 reduction as an 
attractive model to further explore in this and other related 
disorders. While the exact mechanism by which altered EAAT3 
levels impact NMDARs subunit composition remains unknown, 
the fact that they can change in the order of minutes to hours in 
response to neuronal activity (Barria and Malinow, 2002; Bellone 
and Nicoll, 2007; Matta et al., 2011), as well as in a long-lasting 
manner by early life experience (Quinlan et al., 1999; RodenasRuano et al., 2012) strongly suggests that EAAT3 not only limits 
NMDARs function by rapidly binding synaptically released 
glutamate (Scimemi et al., 2009), but also might lead to a cascade 
of events that, ultimately, can modify the relative levels of NR2B 
to NR2A subunits composition of NMDARs in a long-lasting 
manner during brain development to impair function. Since 
redox balance also alters NMDAR function (Choi and Lipton, 
2000), the EAAT3-dependent cysteine uptake might also impact 
glutamatergic neurotransmission by modifying the neuronal 
oxidative status. Further studies are warranted to better dissect

Several research works have demonstrated that beneficial microbes with the capacity 
to modulate the mucosal immune system (immunobiotics) are an interesting alternative to improve the outcome of bacterial and viral respiratory infections. Among the 
immunobiotic strains with the capacity to beneficially modulate respiratory immunity, 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 has outstanding properties. Although we have 
significantly advanced in demonstrating the capacity of L. rhamnosus CRL1505 to 
improve resistance against respiratory infections as well as in the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms involved in its beneficial activities, the potential protective ability of this 
strain or its immunomodulatory cellular fractions in the context of a secondary bacterial 
pneumonia has not been addressed before. In this work, we demonstrated that the 
nasal priming with non-viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 or its purified peptidoglycan 
differentially modulated the respiratory innate antiviral immune response triggered by tolllike receptor 3 activation in infant mice, improving the resistance to primary respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) infection, and secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. In association 
with the protection against RSV-pneumococcal superinfection, we found that peptidoglycan from L. rhamnosus CRL1505 significantly improved lung CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+, and 
CD3+CD4+IL-10+ T cells as well as CD11c+SiglecF+IFN-β+ alveolar macrophages with 
the consequent increases of IFN-γ, IL-10, and IFN-β in the respiratory tract. Our results 
also showed that the increase of these three cytokines is necessary to achieve protection 
against respiratory superinfection since each of them are involved in different aspect of 
the secondary pneumococcal pneumonia that have to be controlled in order to reduce 
the severity of the infectious disease: lung pneumococcal colonization, bacteremia, and 
inflammatory-mediated lung tissue injury.

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory viral attack often result in mild to moderate infection; however, life-threatening disease can occur in high-risk 
populations such as infants, elderly, and immunocompromised hosts. Moreover, secondary bacterial pneumonia is an 
important complication responsible for high morbidity and 
mortality during epidemic and pandemic viral respiratory 
infections in infants and children (1–3). It was demonstrated 
that secondary bacterial respiratory infections are caused 
primarily by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of the 
clinical observations and experiments in animal models have 
focused in post-influenza pneumococcal pneumonia (4). In 
fact, numerous studies have investigated how primary influenza 
virus (IFV) infection enhances the susceptibility to secondary 
pneumococcal disease, by increasing bacterial attachment and 
colonization, disrupting epithelial barriers, and altering the 
innate immune response in the respiratory tract (3). Although 
IFV and S. pneumoniae interaction has been extensively studied 
because of its great impact in the severity of respiratory infections, other viruses like the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) 
have been associated to an increased susceptibility to secondary 
pneumococcal pneumonia.
Clinical and epidemiologic data suggest that RSV is linked to 
increases in the frequency (5) and severity (6) of pneumococcal 
disease. It was also demonstrated that mice infected with RSV 
before pneumococcal challenge as well as mice infected with both 
respiratory pathogens simultaneously showed enhanced lung 
alterations and elevated levels of bacteremia (7, 8). Mechanisms 
underlying pneumococcal superinfection include RSV-induced 
local destruction of the epithelium and respiratory ciliary 
dyskinesia that impairs mucociliary clearance in the airways 
(8). Elevated pneumococcal adherence to the respiratory tract 
epithelium is also considered one of the mechanisms facilitating 
S. pneumoniae infection. It was reported that intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), carcinoembryonic adhesion molecule 
1 (CEACAM1), and platelet activating factor receptor (PAF) 
are upregulated by RSV infection in respiratory epithelial cells, 
which are molecules used by pneumococci for colonization (9). 
Moreover, in vitro experiments with HEp-2 cells (human nasopharyngeal), A549 cells (pneumocyte type II), or human airway 
epithelial cell primary cultures showed that RSV virions enhance 
pneumococcal adherence through the expression of the viral G 
protein in epithelial surfaces that serve as an adhesion molecule 
for pneumococci (7, 8, 10). Surprisingly, transcriptomic analysis 
performed by Smith et al. (8) showed that the direct interaction 
between RSV and S. pneumoniae alters bacterial gene expression. 
The work demonstrated that the pneumococcal penicillinbinding protein 1a binds RSV G protein and that this interaction 
alters S. pneumoniae transcriptome increasing the expression of 
the virulence factors pneumolysin and neuraminidase A/B. These 
results indicate that complex interactions exist between RSV,  
S. pneumoniae, and host, which must be fully characterized in 
order to reduce the severity and mortality of respiratory superinfections caused by these pathogens.
During the last years, several research works have demonstrated that beneficial microbes with the capacity to modulate 
the mucosal immune system (immunobiotics) are a potential 
alternative to improve the outcome of bacterial (11) and viral 
(12) respiratory infections. Among the immunobiotic strains 
with the capacity of beneficially modulate respiratory immunity, 
our research group has demonstrated that Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 has outstanding properties. Nasal priming with  
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 is able to significantly increase the resistance against the respiratory pathogens S. pneumoniae, IFV, or RSV 
(13–15). We have also reported that immunobiotic L. rhamnosus 
CRL1505 is able to differentially regulate the levels and kinetics of 
respiratory inflammatory cells and cytokines in mice after activation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) by the nasal administration of 
poly(I:C), or after the challenge with RSV or IFV (13, 14). This 
beneficial regulation of virus-triggered inflammatory response 
in the respiratory tract by the CRL1505 strain correlated with a 
significant reduction in lung damage and improved survival of 
infected mice (13, 14). Of interest, we have demonstrated that 
viability of the immunobiotic strain is not necessary to achieve  
the protective effect. In fact, protection against RSV or S. pneumoniae infections can be improved by nasal administration of 
non-viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 (13) or its peptidoglycan 
(15), respectively. Although we have significantly advanced in 
demonstrating the capacity of L. rhamnosus CRL1505 to improve 
resistance against respiratory infections as well as in the cellular 
and molecular mechanisms involved in its beneficial activities 
(12), the potential protective ability of this strain or its immunomodulatory cellular fractions in the context of a secondary 
bacterial pneumonia has not been addressed before.
We hypothesized that the effect of immunobiotics or their 
immunomodulatory cellular fractions in the respiratory antiviral 
innate immune response could beneficially influence the resistance to secondary bacterial infections. Therefore, in the present 
study, we investigated how the exposure of infant mice to the 
nasal priming with non-viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 or its peptidoglycan influences the respiratory innate immune response 
triggered by TLR3 activation, the susceptibility to primary RSV 
infection, and the resistance to secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. We demonstrated that peptidoglycan from immunobiotic 
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 improves respiratory antiviral innate 
immune response, reduces bacterial transmigration across the 
lung, and limits pulmonary inflammatory damage caused by  
S. pneumoniae after the challenge with poly(I:C) or the infection 
with RSV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microorganisms and Peptidoglycan
Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 was obtained from the 
CERELA culture collection (Chacabuco 145, San Miguel de 
Tucumán, Argentina). The culture was kept freeze-dried. For 
experiments the culture was rehydrated using a medium containing 15 g of peptone, 10 g tryptone, and 5 g of meat extract 
in 1 l of distilled water, pH 7. Then, lactobacilli were cultured 
for 12 h at 37°C (final log phase) in Man–Rogosa–Sharpe broth 
(MRS, Oxoid). The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 
3,000 × g for 10 min, washed three times with sterile 0.01 mol/l

administration of the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern poly(I:C). Infant mice were nasally primed with HK1505 or PG1505 during two consecutive days 
and then challenged with three once-daily doses of poly(I:C) (A). Non-treated infant mice challenged with poly(I:C) were used as controls. 2 days after the last 
poly(I:C) administration lung wet:dry weight ratio (B), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and, albumin and protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) 
(C) were determined. The results represent data from three independent experiments. Significant differences between treated and control groups, *P < 0.05,

phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.2), and resuspended in sterile 
PBS. Non-viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 (HK1505) was obtained 
as described previously (13). Bacteria were killed by tyndallization in a water bath at 80°C for 30 min, and the lack of bacterial 
growth was confirmed using MRS agar plates. Peptidoglycan 
from L. rhamnosus CRL1505 (PG1505) was obtained as described 
previously (15). Briefly, the bacterium was grown in MRS broth 
for 18 h at 37°C, washed three times with sterile PBS, and lyophilized. Lactobacilli were resuspended in sterile water (0.1 g/ml)  
and lysed by sonication in an Ultrasonic Homogenizer (Cole 
Parmer) with cycles of 2.5 min and amplitude of 70%. The cell wall 
obtained was delipidated by successive refluxing with methanol, 
methanol–chloroform (1:1), and chloroform. The delipidated 
preparation was resuspended in Tris–HCl buffer 50 µM (pH 7.5) 
and treated with bovine pancreatic DNAse I (Sigma) (50 µg/ml) 
and ribonuclease A (Sigma) (100 µg/ml) at 37°C, 4 h. Finally, cell 
wall was treated with 50% hydrogen chloride at 4°C for 20 h. The 
PG1505 obtained was washed with sterile water, adjusted to pH 
7.2, and lyophilized until use.
Animals and Feeding Procedures
Infant (3-week-old) BALB/c mice were obtained from the closed 
colony kept at CERELA (San Miguel de Tucumán, Argentina). 
They were housed in plastic cages at room temperature. Mice 
were housed individually during the experiments and the assays 
for each parameter studied were performed in 5–6 mice per 
group for each time point. HK1505 was nasally administered to 
infant mice for 2 consecutive days at a dose of 108 cells/mouse/
day in 50 µl of PBS (13). PG1505 was nasally administered to 
infant mice for 2 consecutive days at a dose of 8 µg/ml, in 50 µl of 
PBS (15). Anesthesia was not necessary for HK1505 or PG1505 
administration since mice did not show any sing of discomfort. 
The treated groups and the untreated control group were fed a 
conventional balanced diet ad libitum. This study was carried out 
in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Guidelines for 
Animal Experimentation of CERELA and all efforts were made 
to minimize suffering.
Intranasal Administration of Poly(I:C)
Administration of the viral pathogen molecular pattern poly(I:C) 
was performed on day 3, after the 2-day treatments with HK1505 
or PG1505 as shown in Figure 1A. Mice were lightly anesthetized and 100 µl of PBS, containing 250 µg poly(I:C) (equivalent 
to 10 mg/kg body weight), was administered dropwise, via the 
nares (13, 16, 17). Control animals received 100 µl of PBS. Mice 
received three doses of poly(I:C) or PBS with 24 h rest period 
between each administration.
RSV Infection
Human RSV strain A2 was grown in Vero cells as described 
previously (13, 16). Briefly, Vero cells were infected with RSV at

a multiplicity of infection of 1 in 5 ml of Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s medium (DMEM). Cells were infected for 3 h at 37°C, 
5% CO2. After infection, 7 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan), 0.1% penicillin–streptomycin (Pen/
Strep) (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan), and 0.001% ciprofloxacin (Bayer) 
was added to the flask, and cells were incubated until extensive 
syncytium formation was detected. Then, Vero cells were scraped 
and sonicated three times, 5 s per time, at 25 W on ice. Cell debris 
was removed by centrifugation at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C. Virus 
supernatant was sucrose density gradient purified and stored in 
30% sucrose at −80°C. For in vivo infection, mice were lightly 
anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally challenged with 
3.1 × 106 PFU of RSV (13, 16). Viral challenge was performed on 
day 3, after the 2-day treatments with HK1505 or PG1505. Lung 
RSV titers and tissue damage were evaluated during 5 days after 
viral infection.
For the evaluation of viral infection, the RSV immuno­plaque 
assay was performed as described previously (13, 16). In brief, lung 
tissue was removed from infant mice and stored in 30% sucrose 
for plaque assay. Lungs were homogenized using a pellet pestle 
and centrifuged at 2,600 × g for 10 min at 4°C to clarify supernatant. Serial dilutions of lung tissue-clarified supernatants were 
added into fresh Vero cells monolayers, and incubated at 37°C, 
5% CO2 for 3 h. All samples were run in triplicate. After incubation and removal of supernatant, 1 ml of fresh DMEM medium 
containing 10% FBS, 0.1% Pen/Strep, and 0.001% ciprofloxacin 
was added to monolayers. When extensive syncytia developed, 
monolayers were fixed with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone:methanol 
(60:40). Then, well were treated with primary RSV anti-F (clones 
131-2A; Chemicon) and anti-G (Mouse monoclonal [8C5 (9B6)] 
to RSV glycoprotein, Abcam) antibodies for 2  h, followed by 
secondary horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse immunoglobulin 
antibody (Anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked Antibody #7076, Cell 
signaling Technology) for 1 h. Plates washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma) after each antibody incubation 
step. Individual plaques were developed using a DAB substrate kit 
(ab64238, Abcam) following manufacture’s specifications. Results 
were expressed as log10 PFU/g of lung.
S. pneumoniae Secondary Infection
Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6B (ANLIS, Argentina) 
was obtained from the respiratory tract of a patient from the 
Children’s Hospital, Tucuman, Argentina. Pneumococci were 
grown on blood agar for 18 h. Colonies were suspended in Todd 
Hewitt broth (Oxoid), incubated overnight at 37°C, harvested, 
and washed with sterile PBS. Cell density was adjusted to 
4 × 107 CFU/ml.
Challenge with pneumococci was performed 1, 3, and 5 days 
after the last administration of poly(I:C) (data not shown), and 
a higher susceptibility to bacterial infection was found when 
the challenge was performed 5  days after TLR3 activation. In 
addition, several published articles performed bacterial infection 5–7 days after respiratory viral challenge considering that 
viral load and cytokine environment are different in the earlier 
and later stages of viral infection (4, 18). Then, challenge with 
pneumococci was also performed 5 days after the infection with 
RSV. HK1505- and PG1505-treated as well as control infant mice 
were challenged intranasally with the pathogen by dripping 25 µl 
of inoculums containing 103, 104, 106, or 107 CFU (log phase) in 
PBS into each nostril.
Treated and control mice were sacrificed 2 days after S. pneumoniae infection. Lungs were excised, weighed, and homogenized 
in sterile peptone water. Homogenates were diluted appropriately, 
plated in duplicate on blood agar and incubated for 18 h at 37°C. 
S. pneumoniae was identified by standard techniques and the 
results were expressed as log of CFU/g of lung. Bacteremia was 
monitored by blood samples obtained by cardiac puncture which 
were plated on blood agar. Results were reported as negative or 
positive hemocultures.
Blocking Experiments
In order to evaluate the role of IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-10 in the 
immunoprotective effect of HK1505 and PG1505, anti-IFN-β, 
anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) blocking antibodies 
were used (16). Different groups of mice were nasally primed with 
HK1505 or PG1505 for 2 days and then challenged with poly(I:C) 
for 3 days as described above. On days 2 and 4 after poly(I:C) 
challenge, mice were nasally treated with 50  μg of purified 
IFN-β (LEAF™ Purified anti-mouse IFN-β antibody, #519202 
BioLegend), purified anti-IFN-γ (LEAF™ Purified anti-mouse 
IFN-γ antibody, #505706 BioLegend), or anti-IL-10R (LEAF™ 
Purified anti-mouse IL-10R antibody, #112708, BioLegend, 
Tokyo, Japan) antibodies or 250  μg isotype control antibodies 
(LEAF™ Purified Rat IgG1, Isotype Ctrl, BioLegend). Twelve 
hours later mice were challenged with S. pneumoniae (Figure S1 
in Supplementary Material). The efficiency of blocking antibodies 
was determined by evaluating serum and respiratory concentration of IFN-β, IFN-γ, or IL-10 12 h after the last administration.
Lung Injury Parameters
Bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) samples were obtained as described 
previously (13, 16). Briefly, the trachea was exposed and intubated 
with a catheter, and two sequential lavages were performed in each 
mouse by injecting sterile PBS. The recovered fluid was centrifuged 
for 10 min at 900 × g; and frozen at −70°C for subsequent analyses.
Protein and albumin content, a measure to quantitate 
increased permeability of the bronchoalveolar–capillarity barrier, 
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, an indicator of general 
cytotoxicity, were determined in the acellular BAL fluid. Protein 
content was measured by the bicinchoninic (BCA) protein assay 
(Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Albumin content 
was determined colorimetrically based on albumin binding to 
bromcresol green using an albumin diagnostic kit (Wiener Lab, 
Buenos Aires, Argentina). LDH activity, expressed as units per 
liter of BAL fluid, was determined by measuring the formation 
of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide using 
the Wiener reagents and procedures (Wiener Lab). Lung wet:dry 
weight ratio was measured as previously described (13, 17). 
Wet:dry weight ratio was calculated as an index of intrapulmonary fluid accumulation, without correction for blood content.
Histopathological examination was also performed in 
order to further evaluate tissue damage. Lungs were aseptically 
removed, fixed in 4% formalin, and embedded in histowax (Leica 
Microsystems). Histopathological assessment was performed on 
5

5-µm tissue sections stained with hematoxylin–eosin. At least 
four tissue sections from various areas of the lung of each mouse 
in all experimental groups were examined.

chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (Mouse/Rat CCL2/JE/MCP-1 
Quantikine ELISA Kit, sensitivity: 2  pg/ml) concentrations in 
serum and BAL were measured with commercially available 
ELISA technique kits following the manufacturer’s recommendations (R&D Systems, MN, USA).
Lung Cells Preparation and Flow 
Cytometry Studies
Single lung cells from mice were prepared as previously des­cribed 
(13, 17). Lungs were removed, finely minced, and incubated for 
90 min with 300 U of collagenase (Yakult Honsha Co., Tokyo, 
Japan) in 15 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan). To 
dissociate the tissue into single cells, collagenase-treated minced 
lungs were gently tapped into a plastic dish. After removal of 
debris, erythrocytes were depleted by hypotonic lysis. The cells 
were washed with RPMI medium supplemented with 100 U/ml 
of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin and then resuspended in a medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated 
fetal calf serum. Cells were counted using Trypan Blue exclusion 
and then resuspended at an appropriate concentration of 5 × 106 
cells/ml.
Lung cell suspensions were pre-incubated with anti-mouse 
CD32/CD16 monoclonal antibody (Fc block) for 15 min at 4°C. 
Cells were incubated in the antibody mixes for 30 min at 4°C 
and washed with FACS buffer. Then, cells were stained with 
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, 
CD11c, CD11b, CD103, MHC-II, IFN-γ, IL-10, sialic acid- 
binding immunoglobulin-like lectin F (SiglecF) (BD Bioscience), 
IFN-β, and CD45 (eBioscience). Cells were then acquired on a 
BD FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data 
were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar). The total number of cells in each population was determined by multiplying 
the percentages of subsets within a series of marker negative 
or positive gates by the total cell number determined for each 
tissue (13, 17).
Statistical Analysis
Experiments were performed in triplicate and results were 
expressed as mean ± SD. After verification of the normal distribution of data, 2-way ANOVA was used. Tukey’s test (for pairwise 
comparisons of the means) was used to test for differences 
between the groups. Differences were considered significant at

Nasally Administered Peptidoglycan from 
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 Reduces Poly(I:C)Induced Lung Injuries
We have previously demonstrated that nasal administration 
of non-viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 (HK1505) reduced lung 
injuries triggered by TLR3 activation (13). Here, we aimed to 
evaluate the effect of the nasal priming with the peptidoglycan 
from L. rhamnosus CRL1505 (PG1505) on the immune response 
triggered by the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern 
poly(I:C) and compare it with the effect induced by HK1505. 
For this purpose, infant mice were treated with PG1505 and 
then challenged with poly(I:C) as shown in the experimental 
protocol of Figure 1A. HK1505 treatment was used as a positive 
control. Lung injury was studied on day 2 post-challenge as we 
described previously (13, 17). An altered lung wet:dry weight 
ratio (Figure 1B), as well as increased levels of LDH activity and 
protein and albumin concentrations (Figure 1C) were found in 
BAL samples of poly(I:C)-treated infant mice, indicating local 
cellular damage and impairment of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Nasally administered HK1505 or PG1505 did not induce 
significant changes in the BAL biochemical parameters evaluated 
before poly(I:C) administration (data not shown). Both, HK1505 
or PG1505 significantly diminished wet:dry weight ratio and the 
three biochemical parameters evaluated in BAL after poly(I:C) 
challenge (Figure 1). HK1505 and PG1505 were equally effective 
to reduce the lung alterations induced by TLR3 activation.

L. rhamnosus CRL1505 Beneficially 
Modulates Immune Response Triggered 
by Poly(I:C) Challenge
In order to evaluate the effect of HK1505 and PG1505 in the 
respiratory immune system of infant mice, we first determined 
the levels of different cytokines in BAL before poly(I:C) administration (Figure  2). Both, HL1505 and PG1505 treatments 
significantly increased the levels of BAL IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, 
IL-10, and IL-6. BAL concentrations of IFN-α in HK1505 mice 
and IL-6 in PG1505 mice were higher than the other experimental groups. No significant differences were found when the levels 
of TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-8 of control mice were compared with 
mice receiving HK1505 or PG1505 (Figure 2). The treatments 
were also able to increase serum IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-10, 
and IL-6, being both HK1505 and PG1505 equally effective to 
achieve this effect (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). No 
differences were found in the levels of serum TNF-α, MCP-1, 
or IL-8 when comparing HK1505 and PG1505 with controls. 
We also evaluated the changes induced by nasally administered 
HK1505 and PG1505 in lung immune cells using flow cytometry. 
Nasal priming with HK1505 and PG1505 enhanced the number 
of CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+ and CD3+CD4+IL-10+ T  cells in lungs

and then challenged with three once-daily doses of poly(I:C). Non-treated infant mice challenged with poly(I:C) were used as controls. Before and 2 days after 
poly(I:C) administration, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1) were determined in bronchoalveolar lavages. The results represent data from three independent experiments. Significant differences between

while no effect was observed for CD3+CD8+IFN-γ+ T cells when 
compared to controls (Figure 3). In addition, three population 
of antigen presenting cells were studied in lungs: myeloid DCs 
(MHC-II+CD11c+CD11blowCD103+ and MHC-II+CD11c+CD
11bhighCD103− cells) and alveolar macrophages (CD45+MHCII−CD11c+SiglecF+). 
HK1505 
and 
PG1505 
significantly 
increased the number of both lung CD11c+CD11blowCD103+ and 
CD11c+CD11bhighCD103− DCs, while no quantitative changes 
were detected in CD45+CD11c−SiglecF+ macrophages (Figure 3) 
or CD45+Gr1+neutrophils (data not shown).
The respiratory immune response triggered by poly(I:C) in 
infant mice and the effect of the nasal priming with HK1505 
and PG1505 in that response were next studied. As we described 
previously (13, 17), the nasal administration of poly(I:C) 
significantly increased respiratory levels of type I IFNs (IFN-α, 
IFN-β), IFN-γ, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 
(TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8) in BAL of infant mice (Figure 2). 
Both HK1505 and PG1505 treatments significantly increased 
the levels of BAL IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α while they 
diminished the concentration of IL-6 and MCP-1 (Figure 2). In 
addition, IL-8 was not modified in HK1505 or PG1505 groups 
when compared to control mice (Figure 2). Poly(I:C) stimulation also induced an increase in the respiratory levels of IL-10 
that were significantly higher in HK1505- or PG1505-treated 
mice when compared to controls (Figure 2). Lung immune cells 
populations were also evaluated in poly(I:C)-challenged mice 
(Figure  3). Poly(I:C) administration increased the numbers 
of CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+, CD3+CD4+IL-10+, CD3+CD8+IFN-γ+ 
T  cells, and myeloid DCs (MHC-II+CD11c+CD11blowCD103+ 
and MHC-II+CD11c+CD11bhighCD103− cells) in lungs as we 
described previously (13, 17). In addition, we also observed an 
increase in alveolar macrophages (CD45+CD11c+SiglecF+) and 
neutrophils (CD45+Gr1+) after the challenge with poly(I:C) when 
compared to basal levels (Figure 3). Nasal priming with HK1505 
or PG1505 increased the numbers of lung CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+, 
and CD3+CD4+IL-10+ T cells as well as MHC-II+CD11c+CD103+ 
and MHC-II+CD11c+CD11bhigh DCs (Figure 3). No significant 
modification of the numbers of lung CD3+CD8+IFN-γ+ T cells or 
CD45+CD11c+SiglecF+ macrophages (Figure 3) were observed 
after HK1505 or PG1505 treatments when compared to controls. 
Significantly reduced numbers of neutrophils in BAL and lung 
were found in HK1505- or PG1505-treated mice when compared 
to controls (Figure 3).
Nasally Administered Peptidoglycan from 
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 Improves 
Resistance against RSV Infection
We next evaluated whether the changes induced by PG1505 in 
the respiratory immune system affected the outcome of RSV 
infection in infant mice as described previously for HK1505 (13). 
Therefore, infant mice were treated with HK1505 or PG1505 by 
the nasal route and then challenged with 106 PFU of RSV (13, 16). 
Evaluation of viral loads of infected mice showed that RSV was 
present in lungs of all the experimental groups during the 5 days 
studied (Figure 4A). However, significantly lower viral titers were 
found in mice treated with HK1505 or PG1505 when compared 
to controls, being both treatments equally effective to reduce 
Figure 3 | Effect of non-viable Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (HK1505) and its peptidoglycan (PG1505) on respiratory immune cell populations before and 
after the nasal administration of the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern poly(I:C). Infant mice were nasally primed with HK1505 or PG1505 during two 
consecutive days and then challenged with three once-daily doses of poly(I:C). Non-treated infant mice challenged with poly(I:C) were used as controls. Before and 
2 days after poly(I:C) administration, the numbers of lung T cells (A) including CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+, CD3+CD4+IL-10+, and CD3+CD8+IFN-γ+ T lymphocytes, as well as 
antigen presenting cells (B) including MHC-II+CD11c+CD11blowCD103+ and MHC-II+CD11c+CD11bhighCD103− dendritic cells, and CD45+CD11c+SiglecF+ alveolar 
macrophages were determined by flow cytometry. In addition, bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) neutrophils and lung CD45+CD11c−Gr1+ cells (C) were determined. 
The results represent data from three independent experiments. Significant differences between treated and control groups, *P < 0.05.

RSV replication in the respiratory tract. Moreover, HK1505 and 
PG1505 significantly improved the body weight gain during RSV 
infection when compared to controls (Figure 4B). The markers 
of lung tissue damage in RSV-infected mice showed that the viral 
infection induced a significant cellular damage and alveolar– 
capillary barrier alterations (Figure 4C). Both, BAL LDH and 
albumin concentrations were significantly lower in infant 
mice previously treated with HK1505 or PG1505 than in RSVchallenged control mice (Figure 4C).
Nasally Administered Non-Viable  
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 and Its 
Peptidoglycan Improve Resistance to 
Secondary Pneumococcal Pneumonia 
after Poly(I:C) Treatment
As mentioned before, respiratory viral infections increase the 
susceptibly of secondary bacterial pneumonia in infants. Taking 
into consideration the beneficial effects of nasal HK1505 (13) or 
PG1505 on the respiratory antiviral innate immune response, we 
next addressed whether these treatments where able to increase 
the resistance of infant mice to secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. For this purpose, we first performed comparative studies 
of secondary pneumococcal infection in Swiss albino and BALB/c 
mice that are naturally susceptible and resistant to pneumococci, 
respectively. We found that BALB/c mice, which are highly 
susceptible to poly(I:C) and RSV, were a better animal model 
for studying poly(I:C)-pneumococcal or RSV-pneumococcal 
infection than Swiss albino mice (data not shown). In line with 
our findings, some works have established that BALB/c mice 
are suitable for studying poly(I:C)-induced respiratory damage 
and RSV-bacterial infections. Stark et  al. (19) demonstrated 
that exposure of BALB/c mice to RSV significantly decreased  
S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeru­ginosa 
clearance. In addition, the work showed that the effect of RSV 
infection on bacterial clearance was dependent on the mouse 
genetic background by performing experiments with C57BL/6J 
and FVBN/J mice, which are relatively resistant and susceptible 
to RSV infection respectively. C57BL/6J mice showed a modest 
change in pneumococcal clearance following RSV challenge, 
whereas FVBN/J mice showed a decrease in pneumococcal clearance following RSV.
As shown in the experimental protocol illustrated in 
Figure 5A, mice were nasally primed with HK1505 or PG1505, 
stimulated with poly(I:C), and 5  days after the last poly(I:C) 
administration challenged with the respiratory bacterial 
pathogen S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal colonization and bacteremia as well as lung tissue damage were evaluated on day 2 
post-pneumococcal challenge. Two doses (103 and 104 cells) of 
S. pneumoniae were evaluated. Pneumococci were detected in 
lungs (Figure 5B) and blood (Figure 5C) of control infant mice 
for the two doses of the respiratory pathogen. HK1505 significantly reduced lung bacterial cell counts and the dissemination 
of S. pneumoniae into the blood in infant mice infected with

during two consecutive days, challenged with three once-daily doses of poly(I:C) and, infected with two different doses of Streptococcus pneumoniae 5 days after 
the last poly(I:C) administration (A). Non-treated infant mice stimulated with poly(I:C) and challenged with S. pneumoniae were used as controls. Lung bacterial cells 
counts (B), hemocultures (C), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and albumin concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) (D,E), and lung histopathological 
examination (D,E) were determined on day 2 post-pneumococcal challenge. Scale bar = 100 μm. The results represent data from three independent experiments.

103 pneumococcal cells while no significant differences in these 
parameters were found in animals infected with 104 pneumococcal cells (Figure 5). Interestingly, PG1505 significantly reduced 
lung bacterial cell counts and the dissemination of the respiratory 
pathogen into the blood in infant mice infected with both 103 
and 104 pneumococcal cells (Figures 5B,C). Evaluation of lung 
tissue injury showed that secondary pneumococcal pneumonia 
induced a significant cellular damage and alveolar–capillary 
barrier alterations as demonstrated by the significant higher 
levels of BAL LDH and albumin when compared to basal levels 
(Figures 5D,E). Lung histological examination revealed inflammatory cell recruitment around alveoli and blood vessels, focal 
hemorrhage, and a significant reduction of gas exchange spaces 
(Figures 5D,E). Biochemical markers and histology also showed 
that lung tissue injuries were comparable in mice infected with 
both 103 and 104 pneumococcal cells. BAL LDH and albumin 
concentrations were significantly lower in infant mice treated 
with HK1505 or PG1505 when compared to controls for both 103 
and 104 pneumococcal cells (Figures 5D,E). Moreover, lung histology of HK1505- or PG1505-treated mice showed a significant 
reduction in the alterations of gas exchange spaces, hemorrhage, 
and inflammatory cells infiltration.

Secondary Pneumococcal Pneumonia
Our previous results indicate that IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-10 are 
involved in the immunoregulatory effects of nasally administered 
immunobiotics (12). Moreover, as we described in Figure 2, the 
levels of these three cytokines were significantly increased in the 
respiratory tract of HK1505- or PG1505-treated mice. Therefore, 
we aimed to investigate the levels of IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-10 
before (day 0) and after (day 2) the infection with S. pneumoniae 
as indicated in the experimental protocol of Figure 5A. The three 
cytokines were increased in HK1505 and PG1505 groups indicating that their elevated levels persisted up to 5 days of the last 
poly(I:C) administration (Figure 6A). Pneumococcal challenge

further increase BAL IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-10 that were higher 
in HK1505- or PG1505-treated mice when compared to controls 
(Figure 6A). We also investigated the potential source of these 
cytokines within the immune cell populations of lungs. As we 
described previously, we found that IFN-γ and IL-10 were mainly 
produced by CD4+ T cells. In this work, we also demonstrated 
that IFN-β was mainly produced by alveolar macrophages and the 
CD45− population of lung (probably respiratory epithelial cells) 
(data not shown). Similar to the results of cytokines’ levels, we 
found that lung CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+, and CD3+CD4+IL-10+ T cells 
as well as CD11c+SiglecF+IFN-β+ macrophages were significantly 
increased before and after the infection with S. pneumoniae in 
HK1505- or PG1505-treated mice when compared to control 
animals (Figure  6B). Of interest, both CD11c+SiglecF+IFN-β+ 
macrophages and BAL IFN-β levels were higher in the PG1505 
group than in HK1505 mice (Figure 6).
In order to further evaluate the role of IFN-β, IFN-γ, and 
IL-10 in the immunoregulatory effect of HK1505 and PG1505 
during secondary pneumococcal infection we used blocking antiIFN-β, anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-10R antibodies as described in the 
experimental protocol of Figure S2 in Supplementary Material. 
Treatment of mice with anti-IFN-β significantly abolished the 
capacity of HK1505 and PG1505 to avoid pneumococcal dissemination into the blood although it had no effect on lung bacterial 
cell counts (Figure 7A). In addition, the ability of HK1505 and 
PG1505 to protect against pulmonary damage was lost with antiIFN-β antibodies administration (Figure 7D). Treatment with 
anti-IFN-γ significantly abolished the capacity of HK1505 and 
PG1505 to reduce lung bacterial cell counts and had no effect 
on bacteremia (Figure 7B) or in the protection against lung tissue damage (Figure 7E). On the other hand, administration of 
anti-IL-10R to infant mice significantly abolished the capacity of 
HK1505 and PG1505 to reduce lung tissue injuries (Figure 7F), 
while they did not affect lung pneumococcal colonization or dissemination into the blood (Figure 7C).
Nasally Administered Non-Viable  
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 and Its 
Peptidoglycan Improve Resistance to 
Secondary Pneumococcal Pneumonia 
after RSV Infection
Finally, we aimed to evaluate whether HK1505 or PG1505 treatments were able to protect against secondary pneumococcal 
pneumonia after the infection of infant mice with RSV. For this 
purpose, mice were nasally primed with HK1505 or PG1505, 
infected with RSV, and 5  days after the infection they were 
challenged with 103 cells of S. pneumoniae. Similar to the experiments performed with poly(I:C), pneumococcal colonization 
and bacteremia were evaluated on day 2 post-pneumococcal 
challenge. In addition, RSV titers as well as lung tissue damage 
were studied before (day 0) and after (day 2) the infection with 
S. pneumoniae (Figure  8). RSV was detected in the lungs of 
infected infant mice before and after pneumococcal infection 
(Figure 8A). In addition, pneumococci were detected in lungs 
(Figure 8B) and blood (Figure 8C) of control infant mice. Both, 
HK1505 and PG1506 significantly reduced RSV titers as well as 
lung bacterial cell counts and the dissemination of S. pneumoniae into the blood (Figures 8A–C), which was in line with the 
improved survival of HK1505- and PG1506-treated mice when 
compared to controls (Figure 8D). Of interest, PG1505 was more 
effective than HK1505 to diminish lung bacterial cell counts. 
When lung injury was studied, it was observed that the secondary 
pneumococcal pneumonia induced a significant increase of the 
BAL biochemical parameters that evaluate cellular damage and 
alveolar–capillary barrier alterations (Figure  8E). In addition, 
histological examination of lungs showed a significant reduction 
of gas exchange spaces, inflammatory cell recruitment, and focal 
hemorrhage (Figure  8F). HK1505 and PG1505 significantly 
reduced pulmonary damage as demonstrated by the diminished 
BAL LDH and albumin concentrations and the lower histological 
alterations when compared to controls (Figures 8E,F).
DISCUSSION
It was established that the mortality associated to respiratory 
viral infections is not due to the viral infection alone but instead, 
secondary bacterial pneumonia complicates many severe cases 
in infected hosts (1–3). Therefore, it is crucial to understand 
how respiratory viral infections alter the host’s respiratory 
microenvironment and the local innate immunity to benefit the 
establishment of secondary bacterial infections, in order develop 
preventive or therapeutic strategies aimed to protect against mortality. Considering the elevated incidence of viral infections and 
the high frequency of associated secondary bacterial infections 
that contribute to aggravate the health status, several approaches 
are been investigated for preventing or treating respiratory superinfections, including antibiotics and immunomodulatory drugs 
(20). To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the potential 
protective ability of immunobiotics or their immunomodulatory 
cellular fractions in the context of a secondary bacterial pneumonia. Therefore, we demonstrated here for the first time, that 
the nasal priming with peptidoglycan from the immunobiotic  
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 is able to improve the resistance of infant 
mice to primary RSV infection and secondary pneumococcal 
pneumonia.
The first conclusion that can be obtained from the data presented in this work is that peptidoglycan from immunobiotic  
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 preserves the immunomodulatory properties of the viable strain. We have demonstrated previously that 
the nasal priming with viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 beneficially 
modulates the respiratory immune response triggered by TLR3 
activation and increases the resistance to RSV infection (13). 
Similar to viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505, its purified peptidoglycan administered before the nasal challenge with three once-daily 
doses of poly(I:C) significantly increased the levels of BAL type 
I IFNs, especially IFN-β. Thus, PG1505 would enhance the 
expression of hundreds of IFNs-induced genes that counteract 
viral replication. This is in line with the improved resistance 
of PG1505-treated infant mice to the infectious challenge with 
RSV. Moreover, PG1505 differentially regulated the production 
of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to TLR3 
activation which are also important for the generation of an 
effective respiratory antiviral response. PG1505 improved the

its peptidoglycan (PG1505) on the resistance to secondary pneumococcal pneumonia after the nasal administration of the viral pathogen-associated molecular 
pattern poly(I:C). Infant mice were nasally primed with HK1505 or PG1505 during two consecutive days, and then challenged with three once-daily doses of 
poly(I:C). On days 2 and 4 after poly(I:C) challenge, mice were nasally treated anti-IFN-β, anti-IFN-γ, or anti-IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) blocking antibodies. Control 
HK1505 and PG1505 received isotype control antibodies. Twelve hours later mice were challenged with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Lung bacterial cells counts 
and hemocultures (A–C), as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and albumin concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) (D–F) were determined on 
day 2 post-pneumococcal challenge. The results represent data from three independent experiments. Significant differences between treated and control groups,

production of some cytokines (TNF-α, IL-10) while it reduced 
the levels of other pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, MIP-1) 
indicating that the inflammatory response was differentially 
modulated. In fact, PG1505-treated mice showed an improved 
capacity to control RSV replication in the respiratory tract and a 
reduced inflammatory damage in the lung tissue. Resembling the 
effect of viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 (13), PG1505 improved 
the numbers of CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+, MHC-II+CD11blowCD103+, 
and MHC-II+CD11bhighCD103− DCs as well as the respiratory 
levels of IFN-γ indicating the generation of a Th1 response, that 
is also involved in the immune protection against respiratory viral 
attack. These results indicate that peptidoglycan is a key bacterial 
component involved in the immunomodulatory and antiviral 
capacity of the immunobiotic strain L. rhamnosus CRL1505.
An important finding of this work is that both HK1505 and 
PG1505 were able to differentially modulate the response of 
infant mice to the secondary pneumococcal pneumonia produced after the challenge with poly(I:C) or RSV. Slight but still 
significant reduction of pneumococcal cell counts were found in 
the lungs of HK1505- or PG1505-treated mice when compared

challenged with RSV and, infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae 5 days after the viral infection. Non-treated infant mice infected with RSV and challenged with  
S. pneumoniae were used as controls. Lung RSV titers (A), lung bacterial cells counts (B), hemocultures (C), survival (D), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and 
albumin concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) (E), and lung histopathological examination (F) were determined on day 2 post-pneumococcal challenge.

to controls. The effect of HK1505 and PG1505 in reducing lung 
pneumococcal cell counts was modest compared with our own 
previous studies. We had reported that the nasal administration 
of viable Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 to adult and infant mice 
reduced in more than 2 log S. pneumoniae cell counts in lungs 
(21). In addition, non-viable L. casei CRL431 (22), and non-viable 
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 or its peptidoglycan (15) allowed to 
immunocopromised malnourished mice to completely eliminate 
S. pneumoniae from lungs. Moreover, HK1505 and PG1505 
evaluated in an infant mice model of primary pneumococcal 
infection also reduced in more than 2 log S. pneumoniae cell 
counts in lungs when compared to untreated controls (data not 
shown). Then, immunobiotics and their cellular fractions would 
be more efficient to improve resistance to primary than secondary 
pneumococcal pneumonia.
Despite the modest results obtained by measuring the burden 
of the pathogen in the respiratory tract, PG1505 treatment was 
able to significantly reduce lung tissue damage and bacterial 
dissemination into the blood stream. These findings are of 
importance because studies in clinical trials (5, 6) and animal 
models of RSV-S. pneumoniae superinfection (7, 8) showed that 
enhanced lung injuries and elevated levels of bacteremia are 
critical factors that determine the severity of infection and the 
rate of mortality. In fact, PG1505-treated infant mice showed 
a significant improvement of survival after superinfection 
with RSV and S. pneumoniae. As mentioned before, several 
modifications induced by respiratory viruses are involved in 
facilitating S. pneumoniae infection, including the destruction of 
the respiratory epithelium, ciliary dyskinesia, enhancement of 
adhesion factors, and alterations of the immune response (7–10). 
In relation to immunopathology, it was reported that sequential 
infection with RSV and S. pneumoniae induced a significantly 
greater inflammation with high levels of infiltrated neutrophils 
and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the lung 
compared with mice that were inoculated with each pathogen 
separately (19). It is possible to speculate that the protective 
effect of PG1505 would be exerted at different levels. (a) The 
improvement of antiviral response and the consequent reduction 
of RSV titers in the lung, would contribute to the reduction of 
respiratory epithelium damage. (b) A reduction S. pneumoniae 
adhesion by diminishing the expression of RSV G protein and 
adhesion molecules in respiratory epithelial cells. In relation to 
this point, although we have not evaluated the impact of PG1505 
in the expression of adhesion molecules in the respiratory 
tract, our recent transcriptomic studies evaluating the effect of  
L. rhamnosus CRL1505 in poly(I:C) challenged intestinal epithelial cells showed that the immunobiotic strain is able to differentially modulate the expression of several adhesion molecules 
including selectins E and L as well as ICAM-1, and EPCAM (23). 
Therefore, evaluating the effect of PG1505 on the expression of

relevant adhesion molecules in respiratory epithelial cells is an 
interesting topic for future investigations. (c) The differential 
modulation of the respiratory innate immune response that 
allow a reduction of RSV and S. pneumoniae replication with 
minimal inflammatory damage of lung tissue.
Our results suggest that pneumococcal growth in lungs, 
dissemination into blood, and inflammatory tissue damage 
are events which are not strictly coupled with each other. 
Moreover, they are regulated by different factors during the 
development of secondary pneumococcal pneumonia as 
became evident when experiment with blocking anti-IFN-β, 
anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-10R antibodies were performed. In 
line with our results, Damjanovic et  al. (24) demonstrated 
in a mice model of IFV-S. pneumoniae superinfection that 
uncontrolled bacterial outgrowth and excessive inflammation 
are not strictly coupled events, and that both are contributors 
to deleterious lung immunopathology and death. In fact, the 
work reported that the use of a bacteriostatic antibiotic effectively improved clinical outcome by controlling pneumococcal 
replication but it failed to significantly diminish pulmonary 
immunopathology. On the other hand, the use of dexamethasone slightly reduced immunopathology while it had no 
impact on bacterial clearance. Interestingly, administration of 
dexamethasone in combination the bacteriostatic antibiotic 
significantly improved pulmonary immunopathology, bacterial elimination, and most importantly the survival of infected 
mice (24). All these results together suggest that effective 
intervention strategies for respiratory superinfections need to 
involve an efficient control of pathogens growth and aberrant 
host inflammatory responses.
We found that at least three cytokines are involved in the 
immunomodulatory protective effect of HK1505 and PG1505 
in the respiratory superinfection: IL-10, IFN-β, and IFN-γ. Our 
results indicated that IL-10 was involved in the protection against 
inflammatory damage while IFN-γ participated in the reduction 
of pneumococcal growth in the lungs. This is in line with our previous findings demonstrating that the protection of infant mice 
against poly(I:C) or RSV challenge induced by viable L. rhamnosus 
CRL1505 was dependent of both IL-10 and IFN-γ (16). Moreover, 
as observed for viable L. rhamnosus CRL1505 (16), both HK1505 
and PG1505 improved the numbers of CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+, and 
CD3+CD4+IL-10+ T  cells in the lungs of infant mice. These 
immune cell populations remained significantly elevated when 
compared to controls after pneumococcal challenge, indicating 
their participation in the protection against secondary bacterial 
pneumonia.
In addition, we showed that IFN-β was involved in the 
protection against lung tissue injury as well in the control of 
pneumococcal dissemination into the blood. The lung epithelial–endothelial layer is an important barrier in pneumococcal 
pathogenesis, since its alteration results in serious complications such as bacteremia and meningitis that are associated with 
high mortality. Some works have demonstrated an important 
role of IFN-β in the control of pneumococcal infection and 
invasiveness. Studies in IFNAR1 or IFN-β knockout mice 
showed that the abolishment of the IFN-β-IFNAR1 pathway 
increased nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced mortality 
upon pneumococcal infection (25, 26). It was also demonstrated 
by LeMessurier et al. (27) that IFN-β increase the expression 
of tight junction proteins and reduce PAF receptor expression, 
which correlates with diminished pneumococcal invasion and 
transmigration of pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells. In 
addition, intranasal administration of IFN-β was found to protect mice against the development of pneumococcal systemic 
disease (27). The role of IFN-β in secondary pneumococcal 
pneumonia has been also studied. No significant differences in 
S. pneumoniae counts in the lungs of IFNAR1−/− and IFNAR1+/+ 
mice were observed after pneumococcal challenge. However, 
pneumococci were observed earlier and at higher numbers 
in blood samples of IFNAR1−/− mice compared to wild-type 
animals (27). We demonstrated here that the improvement of 
IFN-β by PG1505 treatment would be related to the enhancement of CD11c+SiglecF+IFN-β+ alveolar macrophages. This is in 
line with studies demonstrating that alveolar macrophages are 
the main producers of type I IFNs during pulmonary viral infections (28, 29). However, it should be noted that the primary type 
I IFN response is mediated not only by alveolar macrophages 
but also by epithelial cells of the respiratory tract (25, 27). 
Therefore, respiratory epithelial cells may represent promising 
cellular target for future mechanistic studies in order to explain 
the protective effect of PG1505.
Our results demonstrated that the modulation of the three 
cytokines (IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-10) are necessary to achieve protection against secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. Therefore, 
an appropriate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors would be necessary in order to obtain full protection without 
affecting lung structure and function. In line with this statement, 
some works have demonstrated that the excessive production 
of one particular cytokine have negative consequences in the 
outcome of respiratory infections. It was showed that excessive 
production of IFN-β during viral infection induce impaired neutrophils responses due to inadequate production of neutrophil 
chemoattractants (30). Although neutrophils infiltration has 
been linked to lung tissue damage, the phagocytic and bactericidal activities of these cells are necessary for the initial control 
of pneumococci. In addition, it was observed that neutralization 
of IFN-γ in IFV-infected mice considerably diminished bacterial 
susceptibility and improved survival after secondary pneumococcal pneumonia (31). This effect was explained by the inhibition 
of bacterial phagocytosis by the excessive production of IFN-γ. 
Data obtained from mice infected with IFV and S. pneumoniae 
demonstrated that the exaggerated production of IL-10 was associated with increased pneumococcal colonization and enhanced 
mortality (32). The work showed that the treatment of mice with 
blocking anti-IL-10 antibodies before secondary pneumococcal 
infection resulted in reduced bacterial cell counts in lungs and 
prolonged survival (32). Moreover, it can be anticipated that other 
cytokines are involved in susceptibility to secondary bacterial respiratory infections. In this regard, recent findings of Chen et al. 
(33) demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-35 
contributes to the decreased resistance to secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. The work reported that IFV infection induced a 
high expression of IL-35 in the respiratory tract and that secondary pneumococcal infection leaded to a synergistic production

of this cytokine. Lung enhancement of IL-35 inhibited the early 
immune response against S. pneumoniae.
In summary, we demonstrated that the nasal priming with 
peptidoglycan from L. rhamnosus CRL1505 differentially modulates the respiratory innate antiviral immune response triggered 
by TLR3 activation in infant mice, improving the resistance to 
primary RSV infection, and secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. In association with the protection against RSV-pneumococcal 
superinfection, we found that peptidoglycan from L. rhamnosus 
CRL1505 significantly improved lung CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+, and 
CD3+CD4+IL-10+ T cells as well as CD11c+SiglecF+IFN-β+ alveolar macrophages with the consequent increases of IFN-γ, IL-10, 
and IFN-β in the respiratory tract. Our results also demonstrated 
that the increase of the three cytokines is necessary to reduce 
the severity of the respiratory superinfection since each of them 
are involved in different aspect of the secondary pneumococcal 
pneumonia that have to be controlled in order to reduce the severity of the infectious disease: lung pneumococcal colonization, 
bacteremia, and inflammatory-mediated lung tissue injury. The 
findings of this work will lead us in new directions to explore the 
molecular mechanisms via which peptidoglycan from L. rhamnosus CRL1505 interacts with immune and non-immune cells of the 
respiratory tract and to investigate whether its immunomodulatory properties are unique or common to peptidoglycans of other 
immunobiotic strains with antiviral capabilities.

Inﬂuenza and other respiratory viral infections are the most common type of
acute respiratory infection. Viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial
infections, which often have a more severe clinical course. The mechanisms underlying
post-viral bacterial infections are complex, and include multifactorial processes mediated
by interactions between viruses, bacteria, and the host immune system. Studies over
the past 15 years have demonstrated that unique microbial communities reside on
the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract, which have
both direct and indirect effects on host defense against viral infections. In addition,
antiviral immune responses induced by acute respiratory infections such as inﬂuenza
are associated with changes in microbial composition and function (“dysbiosis”) in
the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, which in turn may alter subsequent immune
function against secondary bacterial infection or alter the dynamics of inter-microbial
interactions, thereby enhancing the proliferation of potentially pathogenic bacterial
species. In this review, we summarize the literature on the interactions between host
microbial communities and host defense, and how inﬂuenza, and other acute respiratory
viral infections disrupt these interactions, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of
secondary bacterial infections.

INTRODUCTION
Inﬂuenza and bacterial pneumonia are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from
infectious diseases worldwide. Inﬂuenza and other respiratory viral infections predispose patients
to secondary bacterial super-infections, which are frequently associated with a more severe clinical
course. It is estimated that the so-called “Spanish Flu” pandemic of H1N1 inﬂuenza A virus from
1918 to 1919 resulted in more than 50 million deaths, with many caused by bacterial superinfection leading to secondary pneumonia (1–7). Even in the antibiotic era, over half of patients
with severe infections in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemics had bacterial complications
(8–10). Bacterial co-infection was also detected in ∼30% of cases in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, with
high mortality rates despite administration of appropriate antibiotics (11–18). Thus, it is evident
that a better understanding of the pathogenesis of secondary bacterial pneumonia following viral
infections is needed in order to make therapeutic strides for this devastating complication.
The mechanisms of post-viral bacterial infection are complex, comprising multifactorial
processes mediated by interactions between viruses, bacteria, and the host immune system.
Hanada et al.
Microbiome and Secondary Bacterial Pneumonia
The pathogenesis of super-infection has been attributed to
direct mucosal/epithelial damage by inﬂuenza virus, increased
bacterial colonization of the upper and lower respiratory tracts
(URT and LRT, respectively), and dysregulation of immune
responses, which all lead to increased susceptibility to secondary
bacterial infections. However, emerging evidence suggests that
our microbial communities residing on our mucosal surfaces
likely shape the rigor of our immune responses and shape the
ecological relationships between host and pathogens. Over the
past 10 years, intense interest has focused on examining how the
microbial communities which inhabit our bodies—which some
consider to be a separate “organ system” given the sheer physical
bulk, number of genes, and metabolic activities—govern the
balance between health and susceptibility to diseases, including
infections. This raises the possibility that disruptions in the
normal microbial communities by an acute viral infection might
contribute to the development of post-viral bacterial pneumonia.
The recent development of culture-independent methods
of microbial identiﬁcation has enabled the study of microbial
communities on mucosal surfaces of the human body, referred
to as “microbiota.” The microbial communities of mammalian
hosts are diverse, comprised of bacterial, viruses, archaea,
parasites, and fungi. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP)
and other similar large-scale sequencing projects worldwide
have characterized the distinct microbial communities that have
adapted to the unique environmental niches within our bodies,
such as the gut, skin, airways, genitourinary tract, and oral cavity.
The gut microbiome, in particular, has been shown to play an
integral role in shaping the immune system starting early in life,
with continued inﬂuence on priming the nature and robustness
of immune responses throughout one’s lifetime. The respiratory
tract also harbors distinct communities of microbes, with
multiple discrete ecological niches (e.g., nasal cavity, oropharynx,
upper airways) that vary in terms of temperature, pH, oxygen
tension, mucus production, and other factors.
The eﬀects of viral infections on both the gut and respiratory
microbiome have recently undergone examination. Surprisingly,
inﬂuenza infection has been found to result in signiﬁcant
changes in the gut microbiome, despite the lack of detectable
virions in the GI tract. By comparison, the eﬀects of viral
infection on the respiratory microbiome appear to be relatively
modest, but detectable. While the eﬀects of these alterations on
risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia have not been studied,
potential mechanisms by which these changes might modulate
susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections include alterations
in the nature and magnitude of the immune response in the
host (microbiome on host eﬀects) and facilitating growth of
pathogens in the absence of normal commensals (inter-microbial
eﬀects). In this article, we review the current understanding
of how alterations in the microbiome following viral infection
might alter host immune responses and increase susceptibility to
secondary bacterial infections. Although the term “microbiome”
encompasses all microbial communities, there is currently a
paucity of studies on how the mycobiome (fungal microbiome)
and the virome (viral microbiome) aﬀect host defense against
respiratory infections and vice-versa; thus, this review will focus
on the bacterial microbiome literature.
THE GUT MICROBIOME AND
RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS
Of the niches in the body, the gut microbial community has
been the most intensively studied, with over 20,000 publications
to date. While the virome and mycobiome (fungi) are also
being analyzed, the bulk of the literature has focused on the
bacterial component of the microbiome, and thus most of our
understanding of the relation of the gut microbiome to host
immunity and pathogenesis of chronic diseases comes largely
from studies of the bacterial community. During health, the
human gut bacterial community is diverse, with each individual
harboring over 100 trillion bacteria, comprised of over 150
diﬀerent species. The gastrointestinal microbiota is dominated
by Firmicutes (e.g., Lactobacillus, Bacillus, and Clostridium)
and Bacteroidetes (e.g., Bacteroides), with lower abundances
of Proteobacteria (e.g., Escherichia) and Actinobacteria (e.g.,
Biﬁdobacterium) (19, 20). Wild-living mice exhibit more diverse
microbiomes, with signiﬁcant abundance of Proteobacteria as
well as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (21). The gut microbiome,
in addition to its metabolic functions in the host, plays an
integral role in the development, instruction, and priming of the
immune system. Germ-free (GF) mice (which lack microbiota)
have markedly underdeveloped gut-associated lymphoid tissues,
decreased number and smaller-sized Peyer’s patches and
mesenteric lymph nodes, and defects in antibody production,
compared to speciﬁc pathogen free (SPF) mice. Not surprisingly,
germ-free animals exhibit increased susceptibility to multiple
types of infections, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites
(22–27). However, compared to free-living mice or laboratory
animals exposed to gut ﬂora from wild mice, SPF animals have a
more limited microbial community and are also more susceptible
to inﬂammatory diseases, with a reduced immune repertoire
including deﬁcits in memory responses (21, 28, 29).
Although
an
extensive
discussion
of
the
healthy
gut
microbiome and its impact on host immunity is beyond the
scope of this review, we will highlight a few important aspects
of how the intestinal bacterial community microbiome maintains
a healthy host immune environment. First, bacterial metabolites
generated by gut commensals contribute to the maintenance
of intact epithelial integrity, regulatory T-cell development,
and a relatively anti-inﬂammatory immune state. In particular,
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate,
and butyrate are fermentation products of dietary ﬁber and
carbohydrates by large intestinal bacteria (30). In addition to
being a major energy source for intestinal epithelial cells, SCFAs
promote the development of naive CD4+ T cells into regulatory
T cells (31, 32), induce “tolerogenic” dendritic cells in the
intestinal mucosa (33), and limit autoimmity (34, 35). At the
same time, microbial metabolites are integral for promoting
immune responses in the gut against pathogens, including
inducing secretion of IL-18 (36) and defensins (37, 38). Thus,
the products of microbiome metabolism are integral to the
appropriate regulation of mucosal barrier integrity and immune
homeostasis. In addition, speciﬁc members of the bacterial
community have been shown to foster the proper maturation
and development of the immune system. While this is still an

area undergoing intense investigation, one notable example is
the discovery that segmented ﬁlamentous bacteria are critical
promoters of intestinal mucosal IgA production (39, 40)and
Th17 cell induction (41, 42).
Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the normal composition of
the microbiome, is associated with a variety of chronic diseases,
many of which are characterized by chronic inﬂammation or
abnormal metabolism, including inﬂammatory bowel disease,
cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Thus, fostering appropriate
levels of diversity and composition of the gut microbial
community is critical for promoting health and immune
homeostasis. During health, the composition of the microbiome
is governed by a number of selective pressures unique to each
anatomic niche, including temperature, nutrient availability, pH,
oxygen tension, and the local immune environment. Shortterm perturbations in the gut microenvironment caused by
illness, antibiotic usage, or dietary changes (e.g., starvation) can
alter the gut microbiome and subsequently lead to transient
alterations in immune responses. Thus, investigating whether
inﬂuenza and other respiratory viruses alter the gastrointestinal
microbiome could have mechanistic implications for viralmediated suppression of antibacterial immune responses.
Effects of Acute Respiratory Viral Infection
on Gut Microbiome
Although the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome is
largely inﬂuenced by dietary patterns, respiratory viral infections
could also contribute, along with other stress inducers such as
broad-spectrum antibiotics exposure and chronic inﬂammation.
Using animal models of pulmonary infections by inﬂuenza and
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), multiple groups have shown
that the gut microbiome is clearly impacted by respiratory viral
infections, despite the lack of detectable respiratory virus in
the gut (43–47). In a murine model of inﬂuenza infection,
the investigators found that although the total numbers of
bacteria in the gut did not decrease, there was a reduction
in the quantities of segmented ﬁlamentous bacteria (SFB)
and Lactobacillus/Lactococcus, accompanied by increases in
Enterobacteriaceae. Interestingly, although SFB have previously
been shown to induce Th17 cells (41, 48), ﬂu-infected mice
had increased IL-17A levels and numbers of Th17 cells in the
small intestine and colon, which appeared to contribute to
intestinal injury (43). In this study, antibiotic treatment prior to
inﬂuenza infection ameliorated the degree of intestinal injury,
but not lung injury, suggesting that gut dysbiosis contributed
to local but not systemic inﬂammation. Other groups have
similarly reported increased Proteobacteria (the phylum of which
Enterobacteriaceae are members) (44, 45), decreased Firmicutes
(which include SFB, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus species), and
increased Bacteroidetes (47) following infection by ﬂu or RSVs
but not after administration of live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine
(LAIV), indicating that live viral infection is required for these
changes (47). The increase in Proteobacteria appears to be
mediated by type I interferons (IFNs) (18), which not only
depleted anaerobic bacteria but also increased susceptibility to
secondary Salmonella colitis. However, caloric restriction also
FIGURE 1 | Shifts in the mouse gut microbiome in the setting of inﬂuenza
infection. During an acute respiratory viral infection, changes in the bacterial
composition of the gut microbiome can be observed despite the absence of
detectable virus in the gastrointestinal compartment. This suggests that
systemic immune signals, physiologic changes (e.g., weight loss), and other
still unknown factors are disrupting the normal ecology of the gut, thereby
leading to dysbiosis. However, the majority of these studies have been
conducted in laboratory animals housed under SPF conditions. It remains to
be determined whether human patients and mammalian hosts with more
diverse baseline gut microbiota (i.e., mice in the wild), exhibit similar qualitative
or quantitative changes.
results in increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria and
increased Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, raising the possibility
that decreased oral intake during inﬂuenza may contribute to
changes in the microbiome (45, 47, 49, 50). It has also been shown
that inﬂuenza infection alters intestinal microbiota composition
through type II IFN produced by lung-derived T cells recruited
to the intestine (43). Thus, changes in the gut microbiome
appear to result not from direct viral eﬀects but from systemic
inﬂammatory signals that travel from the lung and trigger local
inﬂammatory responses in the gut (Figure 1).
Effects of Gut Microbiome on Host
Immune Responses
Interactions between respiratory tract infections and the gut
microbiome are bidirectional. While respiratory viral infections
can change the gut microbiome, the gut microbiome also shapes
the adaptive immune responses against respiratory pathogens.
Mice pretreated with an antibiotic cocktail showed increased
morbidity and mortality during inﬂuenza infection (51, 52).
The severity of infection was associated with reductions in
dendritic cell migration rate and the number of local T cells.

before respiratory viral infection mounted an attenuated antiPR8 antibody response, were incapable of inducing CD4+ T
cell-mediated IFN-γ response to PR8 antigen, and had fewer
inﬂuenza-speciﬁc CD8+T cells (51, 52). These mice also had
higher viral titers in their lungs (51). Germ-free mice and
antibiotic-treated mice also exhibit impaired antibody responses
to seasonal inﬂuenza vaccination, which was restored by oral
administration of ﬂagellated E. coli, demonstrating a dependence
on TLR5-mediated sensing of the host microbiota (53).
The gut microbiome is essential for priming innate immune
responses against pulmonary infections as well. During viral
infections, the degree of macrophage response to respiratory
viruses depends on the presence of gut microbes. Macrophages
from animals treated with antibiotics exhibited defective
responses to type I and II IFNs and impaired capacity to limit
viral replication, suggesting that intestinal microbiota provide
immune stimulation that establishes an “activation threshold”
for innate antiviral immune responses (52). A comparison of
C57BL/6 mice from The Jackson Laboratory (which lack SFB
in the stool) and Taconic Biosciences (which are SFB positive)
revealed that SFB-deﬁcient animals have increased lung bacterial
burdens and more severe pneumonia when challenged with
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (54), which
was associated with decreased IL-17-mediated responses in the
lung. Another study using broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment
followed by intranasal administration of S. pneumoniae in
mice demonstrated that microbiome depletion led to decreased
survival, increased lung bacterial burden, and increased systemic
dissemination of bacteria (55). Antibiotic-pretreated animals
displayed altered cytokine proﬁles in the lung compared
to untreated controls following S. pneumoniae infection,
including signiﬁcantly decreased TNF-α levels at 6 and 24 h
after infection. Additionally, in the microbiota-depleted group,
alveolar macrophages and blood neutrophils exhibited decreased
phagocytic
activity,
and
decreased
inﬂammatory
cytokine
production following ex vivo stimulation by Toll-like receptor
(TLR) ligands such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (55). These eﬀects
might be mediated in part by decreased Nod1 sensing of mesoDAP (diaminopimelic acid)-containing peptidoglycan found in
gut microbiota, which previously was shown to be essential
for priming innate immune responses to S. pneumoniae (56).
Thus, antibiotic-induced disruptions in the normal gut microbial
community alter multiple aspects of normal host defense against
acute respiratory pathogens (Figure 2).
Gut Microbiome: Therapeutic Avenues for
Acute Respiratory Infections
Collectively, the studies above suggest that modulation of
the gastrointestinal tract microbiome plays an important
role in acute respiratory infections, but precisely how the
microbiome should be manipulated to promote appropriate
immune responses during acute respiratory infections is
unclear. Currently, clinical studies have shown that although
probiotics do not inﬂuence the incidence of respiratory tract
infection, they do reduce the severity of symptoms and
duration of the illness (57, 58). Pinpointing which members
of the gut microbial community are essential for proper
immune priming is challenging, but necessary for guiding
further microbiome-based therapies. Clostridium orbiscindens,
a member of the human gut microbiome, has been found to
produce desaminotyrosine (DAT) from metabolism of ﬂavonoids
and amino acids. Antibiotic-treated mice exhibited markedly
decreased fecal and serum DAT levels, which was associated
with attenuated type I IFN responses to inﬂuenza infection and
increased mortality (59). Thus, identiﬁcation of DAT-producing
microbiota might serve as a modality for priming type I IFN
responses against viral infections. Another group demonstrated
that oral administration of Lactobacillus plantarum enhanced
the type I IFN response and lowered viral titers in the
lungs in a murine model of inﬂuenza infection (60). Other
Lactobacillus strains are known to enhance TNF-α and IFNγ production by nasal lymphocytes upon inﬂuenza infection
(61). Oral administration of a probiotic cocktail containing
Lactobacillus restored the immune response and enhanced the
activation of signaling pathways associated with recognition
of single-stranded RNA virus (62). An alternative approach
to administering probiotics is to alter the local metabolic
environment to regulate immune responses. A recent report
demonstrated that animals fed a high ﬁber diet had increased
generation of SCFAs, leading to enhanced antiviral CD8+ T
cell immune responses and attenuated neutrophil-mediated lung
injury during inﬂuenza infection, resulting in improved survival
(63). Thus, one strategy for decreasing the incidence of post-viral
bacterial infections is to limit the severity of the primary viral
infection.
However, activation of antiviral immune responses, including
type I and type II IFNs, have been associated with increased
susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia (64, 65).
Thus, another strategy is to enhance immune responses
against common bacterial causes of pneumonia. One group

bacteria), are able to protect against bacterial pneumonia by

THE RESPIRATORY TRACT MICROBIOME
The microbiome of the respiratory tract has also been
investigated in the context of viral infections. Its role in
the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia following
inﬂuenza and other acute respiratory viral infections is unclear.

microbiome on immune responses to respiratory pathogens have been investigated by administration of oral antibiotics to generate alterations in the gut ﬂora,
followed by acute infection, and analyzing host immune responses compared to non-antibiotic-pretreated animals. Multiple aspects of innate and adaptive immune
responses are altered in antibiotic treated animals, including decreased antibody production, decreased phagocytic activity, and decreased inﬂammatory cytokine
production by innate immune cells (e.g., alveolar and peritoneal macrophages) following ex vivo stimulation with TLR ligands.
exogenous microbes. As is the case with the gut, immunity at the
mucosal interface of the respiratory tract is a constant balance
of tolerance of commensal and non-invasive microbes and
immune activation against pathogens. The URT and LRT have
similar microbial community compositions, although microbe
densities are much higher in the former in healthy hosts. Several
factors are known to inﬂuence airway microbiome composition
including infection history, age, genetics, and structural lung
disease.

(e.g.,

and
Proteobacteria
(67–69). The oropharynx contains members of Firmicutes,
Proteobacteria,
and
Bacteroidetes,
including
Streptococcus,
Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Lachnospira spp. (68, 70, 71). Skin
and oral cavity lineages are represented in the nasopharynx—
e.g.,
Streptococcus,
Staphylococcus,
Corynebacterium,
and
Prevotella (70, 72, 73). A limited number of pathogens
including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides,
and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae are commensal bacteria of the
URT.
In healthy individuals, the microbial community richness
(i.e., the total number of bacterial taxa) is lower in the LRT
than that in the URT (70, 74–76). Contrary to dogma that
normal healthy lungs are a sterile environment, a distinct,
and somewhat dynamic lung microbiome can be identiﬁed
using sequencing technology, with microaspiration serving
as the primary route of microbial immigration from the
URT to the LRT (76, 77). The major phyla in healthy
lungs are Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, which mainly include
Prevotella, Veillonella, and Streptococcus (78–80). Individuals
with chronic airway diseases (e.g., cystic ﬁbrosis, COPD)
have increased bacterial populations in the lungs (77) and
diﬀerences in the relative abundance of certain species (81).
Impaired airway clearance due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors
leads to the proliferation of bacterial species that can exploit
this growth opportunity (82). How respiratory viral infection
aﬀects the diversity of microbial communities and whether
viral-induced dysbiosis inﬂuences immune functions is being
examined. Nonetheless, bacterial colonization of the URT is
generally considered as the ﬁrst step in the development
of invasive bacterial infections (83, 84), including secondary
bacterial infections following respiratory viral infection. Bacterial

response to subsequent infections are discussed in greater detail
below.
Studies of the URT Microbiome During
Respiratory Viral Infection
Respiratory viruses enter the human body through the URT and
are the most common type of acute infections of the respiratory
tract. One possible mechanism by which inﬂuenza and other viral
infections might predispose infected hosts to secondary bacterial
pneumonia is by altering the microbial composition of the upper
respiratory tract, fostering enhanced growth of pathogens, and
facilitating the subsequent entry of large bacterial loads into
the LRT (85). This section will examine recent literature on
how acute respiratory viral infections have changed the URT
microbiome.
Cross-Sectional Studies
Given the eﬀects of viruses on enhancing bacterial adherence to
the epithelium (86–88), it is perhaps not surprising that multiple
studies of human subjects as well as in animal models have shown
that viral infections are associated with increased colonization
by potentially pathogenic bacteria (known as “pathobionts”). A
comparative analysis using qPCR to detect speciﬁc bacteria in
adult patients with or without inﬂuenza A infection showed that
Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. inﬂuenzae were
present in 12, 24, and 32% of infected patients, respectively
as compared to 5, 11, and 10% of uninfected patients (89).
In experimental in vitro models, viral infections increase the
colonization rates of various bacteria in the URT (90–95),
including S. pneumoniae and H. inﬂuenzae (86–88). In children,
inﬂuenza is associated with a 15-fold increase in nasopharyngeal
titer of S. pneumoniae (96). Animal models have similarly
conﬁrmed that viral infection, particularly inﬂuenza, increases
bacterial colonization rates in the URT, enhancing the risk of
secondary bacterial infections (97–99). Higher pneumococcal
colonization density has been linked to respiratory virus coinfection and invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, after adjusting
for age and sex (85). Another case-control study comparing
nasopharyngeal bacteria with and without pneumonia also found
an association between nasopharyngeal load of S. pneumoniae—
but not of H. inﬂuenza and M. catarrhalis—and viral coinfection and pneumonia (96). In addition, viral infections
potentially may enhance transmission of bacteria. In a study
of mice colonized with S. pneumoniae and then infected with
inﬂuenza A virus 3 days after, S. pneumoniae transmission
occurred only when all mice were infected with inﬂuenza
and was blocked by an inﬂuenza-neutralizing antibody (95).
However, while speciﬁc bacteria might gain a competitive
advantage during viral infections, this does not universally
translate to all bacterial taxa. A recent study of subjects
with and without respiratory viral infections demonstrated
lower overall bacterial reads from nasopharyngeal samples
in virally-infected subjects compared with uninfected controls
(100).
The relationship between acute viral infections and bacterial
colonization appears to be bidirectional. Bacterial carriage or
their ligands can increase or decrease viral infectivity rate, thereby
positively or negatively inﬂuencing the subsequent host immune
response to viral infection. Viral replication in the respiratory
tract can be enhanced by exposure to S. pneumoniae (101).
Patients harboring S. pneumoniae are more likely to experience
subsequent acute respiratory illness episodes than those without
colonization (102). In addition, bacteria present in the airways
can modulate host responses against viral infection. The
presence of a nasopharyngeal commensal protected mice against
RSV-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. RSV-infected mice
who underwent antibiotic-mediated depletion of Streptococcus
viridans in the nasopharynx exhibited increases in number of
inﬂammatory lymphocytes and airway hyperresponsiveness, and
decreases in regulatory T cell number and transforming growth
factor-β production (103). Others have shown that colonization
of the URT with S. aureus drastically reduced inﬂuenza-induced
acute lung injury and mortality in mice by recruiting a C-C
chemokine receptor type 2+ cluster of diﬀerentiation (CD)11b+
monocyte subset to the lungs and inducing an M2 macrophage
phenotype (104).
With the availability of next-generation 16S rRNA sequencing,
microbiome-based studies have attempted to discern global
patterns of change in the bacterial community of each
anatomic niche during viral infections, such as changes in
diversity. Diversity can be assessed using a variety of indices,
such as total number of unique species of the microbiome
(i.e., richness) or other measures that account for both
richness and the evenness of relative abundance of the
members of the community (e.g., Shannon index). Results
from microbiome analyses have not demonstrated consistent
changes in diversity when comparing virally infected subjects
with healthy controls. This is not surprising given the variability
of the subjects sampled, diﬀerences in type and severity of
viral infections, type and timing of sample collection, and
analysis methodology. In some studies, increased bacterial
diversity appeared to be associated with inﬂuenza severity.
A French study of children admitted to the hospital with
inﬂuenza revealed increased diversity of the nasopharyngeal
microﬂora with increased inﬂuenza severity (105). Children
with severe inﬂuenza showed decreased relative abundance of
S. aureus and increased abundance of Prevotella, Streptobacillus,
Porphyromonas, Granulicatella, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, and
Haemophilus. A recent Chinese study in patients with H7N9
avian inﬂuenza demonstrated signiﬁcantly increased diversity
in the oropharyngeal microbiome of H7N9-infected patients
compared to healthy controls, particularly H7N9 patients with
secondary bacterial pneumonia (106). Conversely, a French
study of nasopharyngeal samples and a South Korean study
of oropharyngeal samples from patients with acute respiratory
viral infections both displayed decreases in diversity indices
during viral infections compared to healthy controls (71, 100).
Both studies included subjects ranging from infants to adults
>80 years of age, limiting conclusions about age-related eﬀects.
Longitudinal studies conducted in healthy volunteers who
underwent experimental self-innoculation with rhinovirus also
failed to demonstrate signiﬁcant changes in diversity of the URT
microbiome, while administration of LAIV vaccine to healthy
adults led to increases in diversity measures following viral

challenge (73, 107). Thus, unlike other diseases where decreased
diversity is considered deleterious to the host, the eﬀects of
viral infections on diversity per se are variable and not presently
considered a good indicator of risk for complications, including
secondary bacterial pneumonias.
Microbiome sequencing studies also enable investigators to
identify changes in abundance among multiple bacterial taxa
simultaneously, beyond just what can be cultured individually.
This allows investigators to determine what groups of bacteria
are changing in unison during viral infection and which are
existing in competition with one another. This information may
have implications for the development of probiotic therapies
(as discussed below). A recent metagenomics-based study in
France reported enrichment of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H.
inﬂuenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae

respiratory viral infections compared to healthy controls
(100). An examination of the oropharyngeal microbiome of
pneumonia patients with and without 2009 inﬂuenza A H1N1
pandemic viral infection showed that Firmicutes (which include
Staphylococcus and Streptococcus spp.) and Proteobacteria
(mainly Pseudomonas amygdali, P. ﬂuorescens, Pseudomonas sp.
UK4, Acinetobacter baumanii and A. junii)—were signiﬁcantly
enriched in patients with inﬂuenza (108). Another study of
patients with 2009 pandemic H1N1 inﬂuenza infection revealed
that the predominant phyla of the upper respiratory tract (nasal
and nasopharyngeal samples) in patients harboring pandemic
H1N1 were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria
although normal controls were not included; however, the
authors suggested that ﬂu is associated with an expansion of
Proteobacteria (109) which is generally less abundant in healthy
hosts. These ﬁndings are supported by another group who found
that Moraxella and Enterobacter spp. (which are classiﬁed as
Proteobacteria) were the most highly represented bacteria in
nasopharyngeal samples obtained from patients with pandemic
H1N1 inﬂuenza (110). However, these studies demonstrated that
there was considerable inter-subject variability, highlighting the
need for longitudinal studies to decipher changes following viral
infection.
Investigators have also sought to determine whether speciﬁc
viruses are consistently linked to enrichment of certain bacterial
taxa. In the nasopharyngeal compartment of Aboriginal and
non-Aboriginal children in Australia, positive associations were
detected between hRV and S. pneumoniae, H. inﬂuenza, and
Moraxella catarrhalis carriage as well as between adenovirus and
M. catarrhalis (111). Another study examining the presence of
20 respiratory viruses by PCR panel and prevalence of bacterial
carriage in the nasopharynx of children found a strong positive
association between S. aureus colonization and inﬂuenza virus
(112). Moreover, S. pneumoniae colonization was positively
associated with the presence of hRV and enteroviruses; H.
inﬂuenzae was positively associated with hRV and RSV; and
M. catarrhalis colonization was positively associated with
coronaviruses and adenoviruses. A 16s rRNA sequencing-based
study conducted in infants with acute RSV or hRV respiratory
infections reported that infants with RSV had signiﬁcantly higher
abundance of Staphylococcus spp. compared to hRV-infected
infants (113). An analysis of the URT bacterial content of 57
healthy asymptomatic individuals and 59 patients with inﬂuenza
virus, parainﬂuenza, hRV, RSV, coronavirus, adenovirus, or
metapneumovirus
by
culture-independent
pyrosequencing
revealed six distinct bacterial proﬁles—i.e., Streptococcus +
Prevotella + Veillonella, Streptococcus + Haemophilus +
Neisseria, Streptococcus, Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Klebsiella.
These proﬁles, however, were not associated with virus type but
were linked to the age of subjects (71).
Given that many human studies are cross-sectional in nature,
it remains unclear whether post-viral bacterial pneumonias
might be the result of viral infections enhancing bacterial
colonization or acquisition, colonizing bacteria inﬂuencing host
susceptibility to respiratory viral infections, or a combination of
both. Another complicating factor particularly in cross-sectional
studies examining the microbiome during viral infections is that
the groups are not well-controlled and the sample numbers
are relatively small considering the number of variables that
could aﬀect the respiratory tract microbiome–such as age,
gender, oral hygiene and nose-picking habits, healthcare-based
employment status, smoking status, medication use, exposure
to small children, etc. The underlying type of viral infection,
sampling timepoint after onset of infection, severity of infection,
and concomittant antimicrobial usage are other confounding
factors. This may underlie the highly variable and sometimes
discrepant observations from microbiome studies in patients
with viral infections.
Longitudinal Studies
There have been few clinical studies comparing baseline pre- and
post-infection microbiomes in otherwise healthy individuals with
acute viral infections due to the diﬃculty of sampling before
infection. However, the relatively few studies available provide
insights into the dynamicity and stability of bacteria colonization
patterns over time, and whether and how perturbations brought
on by acute viral infections alter these patterns. In healthy
children, the major phyla among nasopharyngeal microbiotas
are Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria,
and Fusobacteria, with Moraxella, Haemophilus, Streptococcus,
Flavobacteria, Dolosigranulum, Corynebacterium, and Neisseria
as predominant genera. Changes in nasopharyngeal microbiome
diversity were observed across seasons, with a predominance of
Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria in fall-winter and Bacteroidetes
and Firmicutes in spring; these diﬀerences were independent
of recent antibiotics and viral co-infection (114). However,
another analysis of two nasopharyngeal washes collected 5.5–
6.5 months apart from 40 children and adolescents with
asthma showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in nasopharyngeal
microbiome diversity across seasons, although mean relative
abundances of Haemophilus, Moraxella, Staphylococcus, and
Corynebacterium varied signiﬁcantly between summer and fall
samples and between age groups. Moreover, in 87.5% of
patients, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in patients varied
signiﬁcantly between time points (115). An investigation of
the frequency and seasonal variation in bacterial and viral
load in asymptomatic healthcare professionals during the
winter and summer months showed that of the 100 subjects

Hanada et al.
Microbiome and Secondary Bacterial Pneumonia
tested during the winter, 34 were colonized with at least
one bacterial species and 11 tested positive for at least one
virus. The most frequently detected pathogens were methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), M. catarrhalis, and
coronavirus. In contrast, of the 100 subjects tested during the
summer, 37 harbored at least one bacterium (mainly MRSA
and K. pneumoniae) and four tested positive for one virus
(116).
Several larger scale surveillance studies of mainly pediatric
populations have examined the natural temporal patterns in
bacterial colonization during viral infections. One clinical
investigation assessed the presence and density of S. pneumoniae,
H. inﬂuenzae, and M. catarrhalis in the nasopharynx of children
during URT infection and in the healthy state, and reported
that the proportion of children colonized with these bacteria was
higher during infection than during asymptomatic surveillance
visits. Mean density of all bacterial species was signiﬁcantly
higher at each visit when a virus was detected. Interestingly, the
percentage of colonized children and bacterial density were also
higher at asymptomatic visits in which virus was detected than
at those in which virus was not detected (117). Another study
of 31 families with small children using longitudinal nasal swab
sampling demonstrated that rhinovirus infection was associated
with increased acquisition of S. pneumoniae from the community
as well as increased transmission of S. pneumoniae within the
family (118).
Other groups have examined the eﬀects of experimental
innoculation of hRV into the URT (nares) (Figure 3). These
studies reported no signiﬁcant changes in total read counts
or of the main phyla (e.g., Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and
Proteobacteria) over time in nasopharyngeal samples (73)
or throat swabs (119). In the oropharyngeal compartment,
rhinovirus infection was associated with a strong trend
toward transient increases in the relative abundances of H.
parainﬂuenzae, Neisseria subﬂava and a weak trend toward an
increase in S. aureus (119). By 60 days, abundance of these
bacteria had returned to baseline. Nasopharyngeal sampling
showed completely opposite results, with decreased relative
abundance of Haemophilus and Neisseria spp., but an increase
in the normal nasal commensal, Propionibacterium, in subjects
following hRV infection (73). No diﬀerences in Staphylococcus
were observed. However, the number of subjects were small in
both studies, limiting the power to detect changes over time.
Nasopharyngeal microbiota composition has been shown to
be altered by inﬂuenza vaccination (Figure 3). Administration
of live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV), which is nasally
instilled, to healthy children increased the nasal colonization
density of S. pneumoniae in subjects who harbored this bacterium
at the time of vaccination, and transiently increased rates of
colonization by H. inﬂuenza (120). In healthy adult volunteers, it
was demonstrated that intranasal LAIV administration induced
an increase in the diversity of the nasopharyngeal microbiome,
FIGURE 3 | Changes in the human upper respiratory tract microbiome following viral exposure. Given that bacterial pneumonia frequently arises as a result of
aspirated bacterial pathogens, a potential mechanism by which viral infections might increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections is through increased
colonization of the upper respiratory tract by bacterial pathogens. In human subjects, live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (LAIV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) have been
shown to disrupt the local host bacterial community, with increased relative abundance of potential pathogens (or pathobionts), such as Staphylococcal and Neisseria
species. The major changes in the upper respiratory tract microbiome are highlighted here.
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org

Hanada et al.
Microbiome and Secondary Bacterial Pneumonia
as well as relative abundances of Staphylococcus and Bacteroides
(107). These changes were not observed in subjects given
saline nasal spray. In a mouse model, bacterial density in the
nasopharynx after LAIV administration was increased as much
as 100,000 times compared to inﬂuenza-naive hosts, and the
duration of carriage of S. pneumoniae or S. aureus was also
increased 2 to 5-fold (121). However, systemic vaccination can
also alter the URT microbiome. A longitudinal study of healthy
subjects found a signiﬁcant association between the presence of
Lactobacillus helveticus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus
infantis, Veillonella dispar, and Bacteroides ovatus and inﬂuenzaspeciﬁc H1 and H3 IgA antibody response (122). Thus, it is
remarkable that a relatively mild viral stimulus such as ﬂu vaccine
can lead to detectable changes in the URT microbiome.
Although the data are still preliminary, animal studies
have suggested that antiviral immune activation contributes to
changes in the URT microbiome and facilitate colonization by
potential pathogens, such as S. aureus. In a mouse model of S.
aureus nasal colonization, the absence of type I IFN receptor was
associated with decreased persistence of bacteria (107). Type III
IFN, which is also induced during inﬂuenza infections, led to
changes in the nasal microbiome, including increased numbers of
culturable bacteria. Increased upper respiratory tract persistence
of S. aureus as well as increased risk of S. aureus pneumonia was
observed in ﬂu-infected wildtype mice compared to mice lacking
the type III IFN receptor (123). Currently, however, is it unclear
to what extent viral-induced changes in the URT microbiome
alter subsequent immune responses against secondary bacterial
infections.
Studies of the LRT Microbiome During
Respiratory Viral Infection
Compared to studies of the URT microbiome, studies of the
LRT microbiome following viral infections are relatively scarce
due to the diﬃculty of obtaining uncontaminated samples from
the lung. Samples of convenience, such as sputum, suﬀer from
oral contamination, but bronchoscopic samples are invasive and
expensive to obtain on a regular basis. Moreover, it is unclear
whether outside of patients with chronic lung disease (e.g.,
COPD), the lung microbial burden is of suﬃcient magnitude
to exert robust eﬀects on immune responses and risk of
secondary bacterial infection during viral infection. Data from
a mouse model of inﬂuenza infection seem to indicate that
ﬂu infection has only a modest eﬀect on bacterial counts,
diversity and composition of the lung microbiome (46). In
subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
after hRV infection but not in healthy individuals, there was
an increase in bacterial burden and growth of bacteria present
at baseline, particularly H. inﬂuenzae (124). The researchers
observed that the growth of bacteria seemed to arise from
the existing community. S. pneumoniae intranasally inoculated
into mice pre-infected with inﬂuenza virus ﬁrst colonized the
nose, followed by the trachea and lungs several days later with
purulent inﬂammation. However, this eﬀect was not observed in
uninfected animals. This suggests that pneumococcal infection
may sequentially develop from the URT to the LRT in inﬂuenza
virus-infected subjects (97). Thus, it is possible that some
individuals with inﬂuenza infection might develop changes in
their lung microbiome as a result of changes in their URT
microbial communities.
Respiratory viruses not only alter the bacterial community
in the URT, but also promote bacterial colonization of the LRT
by a variety of mechanisms that impair bacterial clearance.
First, mucus production in the respiratory tract is increased to
facilitate viral clearance during infections. However, excessive
mucus production can lead to airway obstruction by impeding
mucociliary clearance (125). Second, viral infections can also
reduce ciliary beat frequency and the number of ciliated
cells, disrupt the coordinated movement of cilia, and impede
the repair of respiratory epithelial cells, further leading to
reduced mucociliary clearance (126, 127). Third, respiratory
viral infections impair innate immune responses against bacteria
(128–130). Innate immune cells including macrophages and
neutrophils are recruited to the lung by cytokines and
chemokines for phagocytosis and bactericidal activity. Prior
viral infections dysregulate both alveolar macrophages (64,
131–136) and neutrophils (65, 128, 129), thereby inhibiting
bactericidal activity. Thus, with multiple aspects of pulmonary
host defense impaired, it would not be entirely surprising if
a subset of inﬂuenza infected patients developed secondary
bacterial pneumonia as a result of being unable to clear aspirated
pathobionts from the URT.
INTERMICROBIAL INTERACTIONS AND
POSTVIRAL SECONDARY INFECTIONS
In addition to enabling us to determine what is present
during states of health, large-scale sequencing-based microbiome
analyses have also revealed who is not present during disease.
It has long been appreciated that mechanisms have evolved in
bacteria that confer competitive advantages, permitting them
to survive in an otherwise inhospitable host environment.
However, interspecies competition also maintains homeostasis
of the microbial community, either through their abilities
to capture scare resources (e.g., iron), or targeted killing of
other bacteria (e.g., bacteriocins), preventing one microbe from
dominating the community. Thus, it is possible that the immune
response incited by acute viral infections, changes in the host
epithelial surface caused by the virus, or the virus itself might
lead to elimination of a host commensal that is responsible
for keeping pathobionts in check. For example, S. epidermidis
and Propionibacterium acnes abundance in the nares has been
shown to be negatively associated with S. aureus carriage (67).
Understanding these interactions may create new avenues for
therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing colonization by
pathogenic bacteria during inﬂuenza epidemics or pandemics.
One group of commensals that has been examined for its role
in inhibiting nasal carriage by S. aureus and S. pneumoniae is
Corynebacterium spp. An early study in Japan reported on the
eﬀects of introducing a Corynebacterium strain into the nares
of healthy adult hospital workers who were persistent carriers
of S. aureus, with successful eradication in 71% of subjects
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org

Hanada et al.
Microbiome and Secondary Bacterial Pneumonia
(137). The mechanism appeared to be bacteriocin-independent.
In comparison, S. epidermidis implantation did not have an
eﬀect. Whether the S. epidermidis strain used expressed the
serine protease Esp, which inhibits bioﬁlm formation by S.
aureus and nasal colonization (138), is unknown. Subsequent
studies by another group reported that C. pseudodiphtheriticum
inhibited S. aureus growth, whereas C. accolens and S. aureus
appeared to support each other’s growth (139). Conversely, other
investigators observed that Corynebacterium spp. were enriched
in children who were not nasally colonized with pneumococcus,
and demonstrated that C. accolens inhibit S. pneumoniae growth
in vitro by expressing a lipase that releases free fatty acids from
skin surface triacylglycerols, which inhibit pneumococcal growth.
Thus, painstaking identiﬁcation and mechanistic interrogation
of interspecies competition between commensals might lead to
novel insights as to how viral infections might confer competitive
advantage to pathobionts, and how to exploit natural strategies
employed by commensals to restore homeostasis to the host
microbial niche. Interestingly, a recent preclinical study using
a murine model of RSV and S. pneumoniae superinfection
employed nasal priming by a C. pseudodiphtheriticum strain to
augment host defense against the viral infection, which enhanced
clearance of secondary bacterial challenge and reduced lung
injury measures (140).
Finally, direct eﬀects of the infecting virus on bacteria
that comprise the microbiome may facilitate the transition
from pathobiont to pathogen. A metagenomic analysis showed
that pH1N1-associated airway microbiotas were enriched in
genes associated with cell motility, transcriptional regulation,
metabolism, and response to chemotaxis compared to the
same bacteria in non-infected patients (108). These data imply
that inﬂuenza infection perturbs the respiratory microbiome,
leading to the production of secondary metabolites including
immune-modulating molecules. Viruses have also been found
to impair bacterial bioﬁlm formation and disrupt existing
bioﬁlm (141–144). Inﬂuenza has been shown to aﬀect the
S. pneumoniae transcriptome in terms of downregulating
expression of genes associated with the colonizer state and
upregulations of bacteriocins (142). Thus, direct eﬀects of viruses
on bacterial transcriptional patterns might be a mechanism by
which colonizing bacteria acquire invasive potential, thereby
leading to bacterial superinfections.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
There are several areas that must be addressed by future
respiratory
microbiome
research.
First,
it
is
necessary
to standardize protocols used to analyze the respiratory
microbiome, including sampling, processing, and bioinformatics
methodologies. For example, sputum may be an appropriate
material for investigations of respiratory diseases since it
contains components of the LRT and can be obtained easily.
However, more reliable information on the LRT requires
invasive samples such as BAL or protected specimen brush

to experiments conducted in animal models. Even in human
studies, most analyses have been performed in a small number
of patients and have described bacterial communities in
the URT. The role of microbial communities outside of the
lungs including gut, sinus, and skin should be considered in
the context of airway diseases. Third, most studies on the
microbiome have focused on the bacterial component, and have
largely omitted fungi and viruses. The role of viruses—including
the vast number of phages that infect bacteria—and fungi in
respiratory diseases cannot be examined through 16S rRNA gene
analyses, and there are no studies describing the composition
and role of the respiratory virome due to the diﬃculty of
comprehensive analyses for viruses. Fourth, it is not suﬃcient
to study microbial communities based on species composition;
a
functional
characterization
through
transcriptome
and
proteasome analyses is necessary to understand mechanistic
role of microbiome on outcomes of infection. Finally, mucosal
microbiome
manipulations
by
vaccines,
antibiotics,
and
probiotics in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract niches
represent novel approaches for the prevention, treatment, and
management of acute and chronic lung diseases. However, given
that antibiotic therapy could aﬀect commensal bacteria and
hasten the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, more research is
needed on the long-term eﬀects of this therapy. Animal models
should be developed to study the inﬂuence of the URT and
LRT microbiomes on immune responses to respiratory viral
infections; only then will it be possible to consider the clinical
application of microbiome modulation strategies.
CONCLUSION
Respiratory viral infections can initiate a cascade of host immune
responses that alter microbial growth conditions in the URT, LRT,
and the gut (Supplemental Table 1). Activation of inﬂuenzainduced antiviral interferon pathways can lead to inadequate
innate immune cell responses during host defense against
secondary bacterial infections, resulting in the proliferation of
potentially pathogenic bacterial species. Concomitant changes in
the gut microbiome caused by the initial viral infection may also
alter immune cell priming against secondary bacterial challenge,
although this has not been examined to date. Although the
picture is incomplete, recent microbiome literature provides
additional insights into the pathogenesis of dysregulated immune
responses following acute viral infections, that may promote
the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias (Figure 4).
Clarifying the diﬀerences and dynamics of respiratory microbiota
in healthy subjects and chronic lung diseases during acute
respiratory viral infections can elucidate pathogenesis of viralbacterial interactions and provide a basis for developing novel
approaches for the prevention, treatment, or management of
acute respiratory infection and exacerbation of chronic lung
diseases.
