Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder affecting 
1%–3% of the population worldwide. About half of OCD afflicted individuals do not 
respond to currently available pharmacotherapy, which is mainly based on serotonin 
reuptake inhibition. Therefore, there is a critical need to search novel and improved 
therapeutic targets to treat this devastating disorder. In recent years, accumulating 
evidence has supported the glutamatergic hypothesis of OCD, and particularly pointing a 
potential role for the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3. This mini-review summarizes 
recent findings regarding the neurobiological basis of OCD, with an emphasis on the 
glutamatergic neurotransmission and EAAT3 as a key player in OCD etiology.

OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder affecting 1%–3% of the population 
worldwide (Grabe et al., 2000; Angst et al., 2004). It is characterized by recurrent, intrusive worries, 
feelings or unwanted thoughts (obsessions), and repetitive, structured, ritualistic mental acts and/or 
behaviors (compulsions). OCD is clinically heterogeneous, displaying a wide range of symptomatic 
expression (Murphy et al., 2013). Most OCD patients also have high levels of anxiety, likely due to 
the inability to control or stop the appearance of obsessions (Pauls et al., 2014). Both obsessions 
and compulsions are time consuming, causing a high impairment in social and occupational areas 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Current OCD treatment involves cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or combined with 
pharmacotherapy mainly based on serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI), such as fluoxetine, 
clomipramine or paroxetine (Bouvard et al., 2004; Cottraux et al., 2005; Skapinakis et al., 2016). 
However, only about half of patients achieve an adequate decrease in the severity of symptoms 
(Hirschtritt et al., 2017), highlighting the need for new therapeutic options to treat this devastating 
disorder.
CORTICO-STRIATO-THALAMO-CORTICAL LOOP 
MODIFICATIONS IN OCD
Since original reports, neuroimaging studies have consistently indicated that a dysfunction in 
the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loop is involved in OCD (Milad and Rauch, 2012; 
Nakao et al., 2014; Burguiere et al., 2015). In a brief and oversimplified manner, the CSTC loop

is composed of glutamatergic pyramidal cortical neurons that 
project onto striatal subnuclei. From here, GABAergic neurons 
project to basal ganglia and the thalamus throughout both direct 
and indirect pathways; in turn, the thalamus sends recurrent 
projections back to cortical areas (Alexander and Crutcher, 
1990). A normal CSTC loop function is required for regulating 
habitual and goal-directed behaviors (Gerfen and Surmeier, 
2011). Neuroimaging studies, for example, indicated changes in 
the volume of the anterior cingulate cortex and the thalamus in 
OCD patients compared to healthy controls (Atmaca et al., 2007; 
Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2009), an alteration that was shown to 
be restored in responders to SRI treatment (Atmaca et al., 2006). 
At the functional level, hyperactivity of the anterior cingulate, 
orbitofrontal cortex, and caudate (Saxena et al., 2001; Maia et al., 
2008), as well as altered functional connectivity between the 
medial frontal cortex and striatal regions have been reported in 
OCD (Fitzgerald et al., 2011; Posner et al., 2014).
GLUTAMATE SYSTEM DYSFUNCTIONS IN 
THE PATHOGENESIS OF OCD
Multiple neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the 
etiology of OCD. Since clinically efficacious pharmacotherapy 
targets the serotonin system, impairments in this neurotransmitter 
were hypothesized to be disease-causing (Insel et al., 1985; March 
et al., 1989; Barr et al., 1993) and probably explain certain aspects 
of OCD pathophysiology. However, like other neuropsychiatric 
entities, OCD is multifactorial and thereby additional hypotheses 
have been proposed (Pauls et al., 2014). For instance, some SRIrefractory OCD patients can benefit from combined therapy with 
antipsychotic drugs targeting dopamine D2 receptors (Dold et al., 
2013; Dold et al., 2015), consistent with changes in dopaminergic 
system reported in OCD patients (Denys et al., 2004), including 
a decrease in dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopamine D2 
receptors levels in basal ganglia (Denys et al., 2004; Hesse et al., 
2005). Both monoamine hypotheses are supported by reports of 
OCD-like behaviors in animal models where modifications of 
serotonin or dopamine neurotransmitter systems were achieved 
by genetic or pharmacological intervention (Yadin et al., 1991; 
Szechtman et al., 1998; Chou-Green et al., 2003; Ralph-Williams 
et al., 2003).
Over the last decades, increasing lines of evidence support a 
glutamatergic hypothesis in OCD. For instance, multiple trials 
have reported promising results in OCD using glutamatetargeting drugs. Memantine, ketamine, and rapastinel, all 
drugs acting on glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDAR) have 
shown beneficial effects in OCD treatment (Bakhla et al., 
2013; Rodriguez et al., 2016; Modarresi et al., 2018). Moreover, 
Riluzole, a drug that reduces glutamate synaptic levels (by acting 
at both presynaptically and at glial glutamate transporters) has 
been shown to improve OCD symptomatology in about 50% of 
patients when given concomitantly with SRI (Coric et al., 2005; 
Grant et al., 2007; Pittenger et al., 2015). Other studies have 
shown that the adjunctive use of N-acetyl cysteine alleviates 
OCD symptomatology (Lafleur et al., 2006; Lalanne et al., 
2014; Ghanizadeh et al., 2017; di Michele et al., 2018). N-acetyl 
cysteine is a cysteine donor, precursor for glutathione (a potent 
antioxidant), and also increases glutamate levels by activating the 
glial glutamate/cysteine antiporter.
Alterations in fluid or imaging biomarkers of glutamatergic 
neurotransmission have been reported in OCD, including 
increased glutamate content in cerebrospinal fluid of OCD 
untreated patients (Chakrabarty et al., 2005) and a positive 
correlation between compulsive behavior and glutamate 
concentration in the anterior cingulate cortex (Naaijen et al., 
2017). Interestingly, a previous study performed in child and 
adolescent OCD patients reported decreased, rather than 
increased glutamate levels in this brain region (Rosenberg 
et  al., 2004). Higher glutamate concentration was also found 
in the caudate nucleus in child OCD patients that was restored 
after treatment with paroxetine (Rosenberg et al., 2000). Such 
alterations in the levels of glutamate in distinct nuclei of the CSTC 
loop might lead to (or reflect) functional changes that ultimately, 
lead to abnormal neuronal circuit activity. Consistent with this 
idea, three recently developed animal models of OCD display 
glutamatergic alterations in cortico-striatal synapses (Welch et al., 
2007; Shmelkov et al., 2010; Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019).
GENETICS OF GLUTAMATERGIC SYSTEM 
GENES IN OCD
Genetic studies also provide support for the glutamatergic 
hypothesis of OCD, including linkage and association studies. 
For instance, the 5072T/G variant of GRIN2B gene, which 
encodes for the NR2B subunit of NMDARs, was significantly 
associated with OCD in a family-based study (Arnold et al., 
2004), whereas the rs1019385 polymorphism was associated with 
reduced glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate in drug-free 
pediatric OCD patients. Variants in the GRIK2 gene encoding 
the kainate receptor subunit 2 have been also reported in OCD 
(Delorme et al., 2004; Sampaio et al., 2011). Another glutamaterelated gene proposed in OCD is DLGAP3, which encodes for 
the postsynaptic scaffolding protein SAPAP3 implicated in the 
anchoring of glutamate receptors. As discussed below, SAPAP3 
knock-out (KO) mice display OCD relevant behaviors (Welch 
et al., 2007). These findings prompted genetic studies where 
some DLGAP3 gene variants were found to be more associated 
with grooming disorders than with OCD (Bienvenu et al., 2009; 
Zuchner et al., 2009; Boardman et al., 2011).
Genetic studies have also suggested a role for the SLC1A1 
gene, encoding the neuronal glutamate transporter 3 (EAAT3) 
in OCD. This gene was originally proposed in two independent 
genome-wide linkage OCD studies (Hanna et al., 2002; Willour 
et al., 2004). Subsequent family-based association and casecontrol studies found SLC1A1 gene variants that are associated 
with OCD (Arnold et al., 2006; Dickel et al., 2006; Stewart et al., 
2007; Shugart et al., 2009; Wendland et al., 2009; Samuels et al., 
2011). In addition, an association between an SLC1A1 haplotype 
and the appearance of atypical antipsychotic-induced OCD 
symptoms has been also reported (Kwon et al., 2009), reinforcing 
the idea that modifications of SLC1A1 gene might underlie 
the generation of compulsive behavior. A recent study found

that some SLC1A1 variants are associated with white matter 
microstructure modifications in child and adolescent OCD 
patients (Gasso et al., 2015), suggesting that they might also 
underlie the anatomical alterations seen in OCD. Nevertheless, 
a meta-analysis study found just a weak association between 
the SLC1A1 variant rs301443 and OCD, while rs12682807 was 
modestly associated in male subjects (Stewart et al., 2013). The 
lack of stronger association might be attributed to inadequate 
sample size, distinct clinical subtypes of OCD and genetic/
phenotypic heterogeneity of the subjects (Stewart et al., 2013; 
Rajendram et al., 2017). Two genome-wide association studies 
reported no SLC1A1 variants reaching genome wide significance, 
potentially due to statistical power limitations given low sample 
size (Stewart et al., 2013; Mattheisen et al., 2015).
To date, three studies have addressed the impact of SLC1A1 
gene variants on EAAT3 expression/function. VeenstraVanderWeele and colleagues characterized the rare SLC1A1 
coding variant T164A found in an OCD family, which was shown 
to have modest effects on both EAAT3 Vmax and Km parameters, 
suggesting a decrease in the number of EAAT3 available and 
its affinity for glutamate, respectively, which might be involved 
in the disorder (Veenstra-VanderWeele et al., 2012). However, 
no protein quantification was carried out in this work. In a 
second study, Bailey and colleagues characterized the EAAT3 
loss-of-function variants R445W and I395del found in human 
dicarboxylic aminoaciduria; both mutants dramatically reduced 
or abolished glutamate and cysteine transport by EAAT3 and led 
to almost absent EAAT3 surface expression in a cell line model 
(Rodenas-Ruano et al., 2012). Although no psychiatric assessment 
was available for the subjects in this study, authors reported that 
one of the patients carrying R445W variants exhibited features 
consistent with a diagnosis of OCD (Bailey et al., 2011). In a 
third study, Wendland and colleagues described SLC1A1 variants 
that affect mRNA expression in human dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex tissue and that were associated with OCD in a large casecontrol study (Wendland et al., 2009). Collectively, these data 
suggest that gene variants impacting EAAT3 expression might 
underlie the pathogenesis of OCD. A more definitive answer will 
hopefully be provided in the near future through adequatelypowered, large genome-wide association or sequencing studies 
that can yield statistically robust insights into the role of SLC1A1 
and other glutamatergic system genes in OCD.
THE NEURONAL GLUTAMATE 
TRANSPORTER EAAT3
EAAT3 belongs to the excitatory amino acid transporters family 
(EAAT1-5) that regulates the extracellular levels of glutamate. 
Although its expression is approximately 100-fold lower than 
other EAAT in brain (Holmseth et al., 2012), enriched EAAT3 
content is found in CSTC loop, including the cerebral cortex, 
hippocampus, striatum, and basal ganglia (Rothstein et al., 1994; 
Furuta et al., 1997; Shashidharan et al., 1997; Kanai and Hediger, 
2004; Holmseth et al., 2012), in glutamatergic, GABAergic, 
and dopaminergic neurons (Coco et al., 1997; Conti et al., 
1998; Sidiropoulou et al., 2001; Underhill et al., 2014). EAAT3 
is localized peri-synaptically on the postsynaptic spine (Coco 
et al., 1997; He et al., 2000), and several studies have indicated 
that its contribution to the overall glutamate uptake is much 
lesser compared to that of the astrocytic transporters EAAT1 and 
EAAT2 (Tong and Jahr, 1994; Rothstein et al., 1996; Diamond 
and Jahr, 1997; Tanaka et al., 1997). Nonetheless, increasing 
evidence indicate that EAAT3 contributes to buffer glutamate 
released during synaptic events and prolong the time course 
of astrocytic clearance in the hippocampus (Scimemi et al., 
2009), and to regulate the responses of extra-synaptic glutamate 
NMDA and AMPA receptors (Scimemi et al., 2009; Jarzylo and 
Man, 2012; Underhill et al., 2014; Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019) 
as well as metabotropic glutamate receptors (Otis et al., 2004; 
Wadiche and Jahr, 2005). As changes in EAAT3 activity can 
modify the trafficking of AMPARs and function of NMDARs, it 
is not surprising that EAAT3 has been shown to be involved in 
excitatory synaptic plasticity (Cao et al., 2014; Bjorn-Yoshimoto 
and Underhill, 2016; Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019). EAAT3 
can also control neuronal activity through a negative feedback 
of excitatory neurotransmission by regulating the synthesis of 
GABA at inhibitory terminals (Sepkuty et al., 2002; Mathews and 
Diamond, 2003) and by regulating the expression of D1 dopamine 
receptors (Bellini et al., 2018). Collectively, the evidence strongly 
supports the notion that EAAT3 regulates glutamate levels in the 
synaptic cleft and thus the function of postsynaptic receptors. 
Therefore, changes in EAAT3 expression and/or function at 
glutamatergic synapses within the CSTC loop might underlie the 
neurobiological basis of OCD.
EAAT3 has been also suggested to play a role on the neuronal 
redox balance as they also transport cysteine, the rate limiting 
substrate for glutathione synthesis (Himi et al., 2003; Aoyama et al., 
2006; Watabe et al., 2007). Indeed, EAAT3 KO mice have reduced 
glutathione brain levels, which correlates with the brain atrophy and 
hippocampal neurodegeneration in aged mice and impaired spatial 
memory reported in these mice (Aoyama et al., 2006; Berman 
et al., 2011). Increased oxidative stress and a reduced number 
of dopaminergic neurons were also found in EAAT3 KO mice 
(Berman et al., 2011). Correspondingly, mice lacking GTRAP3-18, a 
reticulum protein that interacts with and retains EAAT3 on cellular 
compartment (Lin et al., 2001) not only showed increased EAAT3 
levels at the plasma membrane, but also increased cysteine and 
glutathione brain content as well as improved performance in spatial 
memory tasks (Aoyama et al., 2012). In contrast, mice overexpressing 
EAAT3 have higher glutathione brain levels (Delgado-Acevedo 
et al., 2019), raising the possibility that alterations in redox balance 
might be also involved in OCD.
IMPAIRED GLUTAMATERGIC 
NEUROTRANSMISSION IN OCD ANIMAL 
MODELS
Three different genetic models, namely, the Sapap3 KO (Welch 
et al., 2007) mice, the Slitrk5 KO mice (Shmelkov et al., 2010), 
and the EAAT3 overexpressing mice (Delgado-Acevedo et al., 
2019), have been reported to recapitulate OCD hallmarks 
including cortico-striatal glutamatergic alterations, particularly

changes in NMDAR function, and displaying OCD-like 
behaviors that could be rescued by chronic administration 
of SSRI (See Table 1). Mice lacking SAPAP3 (a member of 
SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein family (SAPAPs)) exhibit 
an aberrantly increased self-grooming leading to skin 
wounds (Welch et al., 2007). SAPAP3 KO mice also showed 
increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field, zero-maze, 
and light-dark emergence tests; both increased anxiety and 
hyper-grooming behaviors were alleviated by fluoxetine 
administration for 6 days (Welch et al., 2007). SAPAP3 KO 
mice also show abnormalities at cortico-striatal synapses, 
including a decrease in AMPAR-mediated transmission 
and an increase in NMDAR-mediated transmission. Such 
alterations were specific for cortico-striatal synapses, as they 
were not observed in the hippocampus (Welch et al., 2007) 
neither in thalamo-striatal synapses (Wan et al., 2014) and 
were rescued by striatal injections of a lentivirus expressing 
SAPAP3 (Welch et al., 2007). While the reduction in AMPARmediated transmission is likely due to AMPAR endocytosis, 
an increased activity of mGluR5 receptors was also reported 
and might be involved in the increase of silent synapses (Wan 
et al., 2011). This increased mGluR5 activity seemed not only 
to accompany the OCD-like phenotype but could also be a 
causative agent, since acute mGluR5 activation recapitulated 
OCD-like behavior in wildtype mice, and mGluR5 antagonism 
reverted the phenotype on SAPAP3 KO mice (Ade et al., 2016). 
Additional dysregulation in serotonin and dopamine release 
and/or metabolism (Wood et al., 2018) as well as deficits in 
behavioral inhibition have been also reported in SAPAP3 
KO mice (Burguiere et al., 2013). While this evidence links 
SAPAP3 to compulsive behaviors, human DLGAP3/SAPAP3 
gene variants seem to be more related to disorders belonging 
to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum rather than directly to 
OCD, as discussed above (Bienvenu et al., 2009; Zuchner et al., 
2009; Boardman et al., 2011).
Similarly, the deletion of SlitrK5 gene was found to induce 
compulsive and anxiety-like behaviors in mice (Shmelkov et al., 
2010). The N-terminal region of SlitrK5, a transmembrane 
protein, is similar to Slit proteins conformed by two leucinerich domains, whereas the C-terminal is similar to Trk 
neurotrophin receptor (Aruga and Mikoshiba, 2003). Like 
SAPAP3 KO mice, increased self-grooming leading to skin 
lesions and facial hair loss has been reported in SlitrK5 KO 
mice (Shmelkov et al., 2010). They also display compulsivelike behavior in the marble burying test and increased anxietylike behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze tests, 
behavioral impairments that were restored by chronic (18 days) 
treatment with fluoxetine (Shmelkov et al., 2010). Importantly, 
SlitrK5 KO mice have selective over-activation of the 
orbitofrontal cortex and abnormalities in striatal glutamatergic 
signaling, including a reduction in the level of glutamate 
receptor subunits GluR1, GluR2, NR2A, and NR2B and a 
decrease in the amplitude of spikes in response to the corticostriatal stimulation (Shmelkov et al., 2010). While the exact 
mechanism by which Slitrk5 deletion impacts glutamatergic 
signaling remains unclear, Slitrk5 might play an important role 
in neuronal development as a rare synaptogenesis-impairing

Glutamate Transporter EAAT3 in OCD
Escobar et al.

mutation in the SLITRK5 gene has been recently associated 
with OCD (Song et al., 2017), suggesting that changes in 
the development and/or maturation of excitatory neurons 
in the CSTC circuit might underlie OCD pathophysiology. 
Consistent with this idea, SlitrK5 KO mice display decreased 
arbor complexity in striatal medium spiny neurons (Shmelkov 
et al., 2010), which might explain the decreased number of 
postsynaptic glutamate receptors and glutamatergic function, 
two hallmarks of OCD disorders.
Mouse models with altered EAAT3 expression have been 
useful to study OCD neurobiology. The first EAAT3 KO mouse 
model was reported in 1997 and indicated reduced spontaneous 
locomotor activity, but no other neurological dysfunctions nor 
OCD relevant behaviors (Peghini et al., 1997). Later, it was 
found that EAAT3 KO mice also display an age-dependent 
decrease of dopaminergic neurons number in the substantia 
nigra, which might explain the impaired locomotor activity 
(Berman et al., 2011). Similarly, changes in the volume of the 
hippocampal CA1 region, associated with an age-progressive 
decline in swim velocity and in spatial memory performance 
were also reported (Aoyama et al., 2006). Moreover, neurons 
from EAAT3 KO mice have been found to be more sensitive 
to oxidative stress (Aoyama et al., 2006), ischemia (Jang et al., 
2012; Choi et al., 2014), and traumatic brain injury (Choi et al., 
2016). Since some of the alterations in EAAT3 KO mice can 
be rescued by the treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (Berman 
et al., 2011), it is plausible to suggest that EAAT3 has a role 
in neuroprotection due to its cysteine donor function. In this 
context, increased oxidative status in OCD patients as well as a 
positive correlation between the severity of OCD symptoms and 
the level of lipid peroxidation have been reported (Chakraborty 
et al., 2009). Increased glutathione peroxidase levels in the 
plasma serum of treatment-naïve children with OCD (Simsek 
et al., 2016) and lower levels of glutathione in the posterior 
cingulate cortex have been also reported (Brennan et al., 2016). 
While animal and human studies indicate that SRIs can restore 
neuron oxidative status observed in mood disorders, to the best 
of our knowledge, only one study has suggested that fluoxetine 
treatment restores the oxidative status in OCD patients 
(Chakraborty et al., 2009).
After two decades of research since the first publication of 
an EAAT3 KO mouse model (Peghini et al., 1997), only one 
study has reported some behaviors reminiscent of compulsivelike behavior in EAAT3 KO mice (Bellini et al., 2018). A second 
EAAT3 KO mouse model was recently developed by a different 
research group and, in agreement with the majority of the studies, 
they found unaltered anxiety or compulsive-like behaviors in 
this model (Zike et al., 2017). Indeed, a decrease in grooming 
behavior and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, as well 
as in D1 dopamine receptor agonist-induced stereotypy (an 
effect correlated with reduced dopamine release in the striatum) 
was reported in this second EAAT3 KO model (Quinlan et al., 
1999). While genetic background (C57BL/6 vs CD1 strain) and/
or the age of the animals might explain some of the differences 
observed in the repetitive behavior in EAAT3 KO mouse, both 
studies highlight the impact of EAAT3 ablation on dopamine 
neurotransmission (Zike et al., 2017; Bellini et al., 2018). 
Altogether, these data suggest that OCD susceptibility might not 
be related to a reduced (or absent) EAAT3 expression/function. 
Consistent with this idea, one of the SLC1A1 gene variants highly 
replicated in OCD genetic studies is associated with increased 
rather than decreased EAAT3 mRNA levels in human brain tissue 
(Wendland et al., 2009). To explore this EAAT3 gain-of-function 
hypothesis, a conditional transgenic mouse line, in which 
EAAT3 was overexpressed under CamKIIα driver (EAAT3glo/
CMKII) was recently reported (Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019). 
This model exhibits increased anxiety and compulsive-like 
behaviors that were restored by chronic, but not acute, fluoxetine, 
or clomipramine treatment. Moreover, EAAT3glo/CMKII 
mice displayed alterations in the glutamatergic system in the 
striatum, including changes in NMDARs subunit composition 
(increased NR2B/NR2A ratio), and impaired NMDA-dependent 
synaptic plasticity (Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019). Interestingly, 
EAAT3glo/CMKII mice also displayed higher spontaneous 
recovery of fear memory, suggesting impairment in long-term 
extinction, which has also been described in OCD patients 
(Milad et al., 2013) and, to the best of our knowledge, for the first 
time in an OCD mouse model (Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019). In 
view of their high density in extinction-related brain areas, the 
NMDAR has been suggested to be a candidate for modulating 
extinction learning (for review see (Myers and Davis, 2002; 
Davis, 2011). However, whether changes in NMDAR subunits 
composition observed in the striatum of EAAT3glo/CMKII mice 
(Delgado-Acevedo et al., 2019) also occur in extinction-related 
areas remain to be determined.
CONCLUSIONS
Converging 
evidence 
from 
genetic, 
neuroanatomical, 
pharmacological, and preclinical studies in both humans and 
animal models support that glutamate dysregulations may 
contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD. As discussed above, 
the findings from genetic mouse models that are relevant of OCD 
not only highlight glutamatergic alterations, and particularly 
altered NMDAR function in the OCD etiology, but also establish 
EAAT3 overexpression rather than an EAAT3 reduction as an 
attractive model to further explore in this and other related 
disorders. While the exact mechanism by which altered EAAT3 
levels impact NMDARs subunit composition remains unknown, 
the fact that they can change in the order of minutes to hours in 
response to neuronal activity (Barria and Malinow, 2002; Bellone 
and Nicoll, 2007; Matta et al., 2011), as well as in a long-lasting 
manner by early life experience (Quinlan et al., 1999; RodenasRuano et al., 2012) strongly suggests that EAAT3 not only limits 
NMDARs function by rapidly binding synaptically released 
glutamate (Scimemi et al., 2009), but also might lead to a cascade 
of events that, ultimately, can modify the relative levels of NR2B 
to NR2A subunits composition of NMDARs in a long-lasting 
manner during brain development to impair function. Since 
redox balance also alters NMDAR function (Choi and Lipton, 
2000), the EAAT3-dependent cysteine uptake might also impact 
glutamatergic neurotransmission by modifying the neuronal 
oxidative status. Further studies are warranted to better dissect
