Background: Specialized inpatient or residential treatment might be an alternative
treatment approach for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that do not
respond satisfactorily to the standard outpatient treatment formats.
Method: The aim of this open trial was to investigate the 6-month effectiveness of a 3week inpatient treatment of OCD, where exposure with response prevention (ERP) was
the main treatment intervention. The sample consisted of 187 adult patients with OCD,
all with previous treatment attempts for OCD.
Results: The sample showed signiﬁcant reductions in symptoms of OCD and
depression. The effect sizes were large for obsessive-compulsive symptoms and
moderate to large for depressive symptoms. At discharge, 79.7% of the intent-totreat (ITT) group were classiﬁed as treatment responders (≥35% reduction in Y-BOCS
scores). However, some participants experienced relapse, as 61.5% of the ITT group
were classiﬁed as treatment responders at 6-month follow-up. Antidepressant use
appeared not to inﬂuence the outcome. Only pre-treatment levels of obsessivecompulsive symptoms emerged as a signiﬁcant predictor of relapse.
Conclusion: The 3-week inpatient programme produced similar treatment effects as
previous inpatient and residential studies of longer duration (2 – 3 months). The results
suggest that patients with severe OCD can be treated efﬁciently using this brief inpatient
format. However, better relapse prevention interventions are needed.

INTRODUCTION
The eﬃcacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) has been conﬁrmed in numerous studies and meta-analyses (e.g., Eddy et al., 2004; Öst et al.,
2015; Skapinakis et al., 2016). According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
guidelines’ (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2005), outpatient CBT
including exposure and response prevention (ERP) should be oﬀered to all OCD patients. Among

treatment completers, signiﬁcant improvement in obsessivecompulsive symptoms is achieved by two-thirds of the patients,
which corresponds to uncontrolled eﬀect sizes around 1.5
at post-treatment (Eddy et al., 2004). In intention-to-treat
samples including treatment dropouts, about half of the patients
experience 25–50% reduction in their obsessive-compulsive
symptoms (Eddy et al., 2004). This leaves a subset of OCD
patients failing to achieve satisfactory response to CBT, and
many experience residual symptoms or relapse during follow-up
(Simpson et al., 2005; Abramowitz, 2006).
In cases where OCD patients have not responded satisfactorily
to ﬁrst-line standard outpatient treatments such as CBT,
specialized inpatient or residential treatment might be an
alternative treatment approach (National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2005). A review of inpatient and
residential treatment programs using CBT for OCD (Veale et al.,
2016b) showed that patients with severe or treatment refractory
OCD can make signiﬁcant improvements with this treatment
format. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding its longterm beneﬁts, especially regarding treatments of shorter duration.
Consequently, the primary aim of the current study was to
explore the 6-month eﬀectiveness of a brief (3 weeks) inpatient
treatment format.
An inpatient setting has therapy and support staﬀavailable
both day and night, whereas a residential setting has nursing
staﬀduring the day only. According to the National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] (2005) guidelines’,
inpatient or residential treatment may be beneﬁcial when there
is extreme distress or functional impairment, risk to life, severe
self-neglect, or where a patient has comorbid disorders that
make outpatient treatment more complex. Inpatient services may
also be required when the response to previous OCD treatment
was poor and the patient needs more intensive CBT or more
assisted exposure than what is possible to deliver in an outpatient
setting. However, a major drawback is the cost of treatment, as
well as the diﬀerent context in which the obsessive-compulsive
symptoms naturally occur. Compared to an outpatient setting, an
inpatient or residential treatment may give fewer opportunities
to consolidate and generalize the learning to the patients’ home
environment (Craske et al., 2008).
Several naturalistic studies have investigated the eﬀectiveness
of specialized inpatient or residential treatment for OCD, and the
results are promising (e.g., Stewart et al., 2005; Boschen et al.,
2008; Langner et al., 2009; Adams et al., 2012; Björgvinsson et al.,
2013; Dowling et al., 2016; Veale et al., 2016a). Two of the largest
studies of inpatient and residential OCD treatment to date are
conducted by Stewart et al. (2005) and Veale et al. (2016a).
Stewart et al. (2005) investigated the eﬀectiveness of an
American intensive residential treatment unit with a mean
treatment duration of 66 days (N = 403). Results indicated a
mean improvement in OCD symptoms of 30%, as Yale-Brown
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores decreased from
pre-treatment (M = 26.6, SD = 18.6) to post-treatment (M = 18.6,
SD = 7.2). Depressive symptoms also improved signiﬁcantly.
Follow-up scores were not reported, but in a second study using
a diﬀerent OCD sample from the same residential treatment unit,
Stewart et al. (2009) found treatment gains to be stable 6 months
after discharge. However, one limitation of the follow-up study
was low sample size (N = 36 at 6 months).
Veale et al. (2016a) described treatment outcomes from a
British residential unit, where one of the aims was to compare an
intensive treatment program of 2 weeks (N = 54) to a “standard”
treatment program of 12 weeks (N = 418). Results indicated
signiﬁcant decreases from pre- to post-treatment in both groups.
In the standard treatment program, Y-BOCS scores decreased
from a mean of 30.8 (SD = 6.0) to an average discharge score
of 18.6 (SD = 7.8). In the intensive treatment program, Y-BOCS
scores decreased from 30.1 (SD = 5.5) to 20.8 (SD = 7.5). There
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in treatment outcome between the
two programs. However, Y-BOCS follow-up scores were only
reported on the 12-week program, with 6 – 12 month followup scores showing a slight deterioration in outcome compared
to discharge (M = 22.6, SD = 7.9).
As previously mentioned, Veale et al. (2016b) conducted
a systematic review of inpatient and residential treatment
programs using CBT for OCD. The analysis included 19
studies with a total of 2306 participants at admission and
2202 participants at discharge. The average length of stay was
10.4 weeks (range: 5.0 – 19.3 weeks), whereas the average mean
Y-BOCS at pre-treatment was 27.61 (range: 24.1 – 34.7). The
meta-analysis showed a substantial amount of heterogeneity in
the estimate of treatment eﬀect size, which Veale et al. (2016b)
partly explained by the wide nature of the treatment programs
oﬀered, as well as variations in admission criteria. Nonetheless,
a large treatment eﬀect with Hedges g of 1.87 and a mean
improvement of 10.7 (95% CI: 9.8 – 11.5) points from admission
to discharge on the Y-BOCS were found. Accordingly, Veale et al.
(2016b) concluded that inpatient and residential treatment is an
encouraging option for those with severe or treatment refractory
OCD. As few studies have evaluated the long-term eﬀectiveness
of their inpatient or residential treatment, Veale et al. (2016b)
did not calculate mean change in Y-BOCS scores from admission
to follow-up. However, the results of the few studies that have
reported long-term outcomes are inconsistent, with some studies
reporting the gains to be stable (e.g., Kordon et al., 2005; Rufer
et al., 2005; Stewart et al., 2009), whereas some found a slight
deterioration (McKenzie and Marks, 2003; Veale et al., 2016a).
Research on predictors of long-term outcome is also scarce.
However, Stewart et al. (2009) found that patients who relapsed
at 6-month follow-up were signiﬁcantly more likely to be living
alone and less likely to have comorbid illnesses.
In general, the main ﬁnding of previous naturalistic research
on the eﬀectiveness of inpatient and residential treatment
for OCD indicates that inpatient services may be a viable
treatment option for patients who do not respond satisfactorily
to outpatient treatment. However, there is a lack of studies
with follow-up data, and the studies that do report follow-up
are often limited by low sample size. Furthermore, most of the
previous studies (84.2% of the studies included in the metaanalysis by Veale et al., 2016b) report inpatient or residential

treatments with duration of 2–3 months, and there are only
a few studies (e.g., Veale et al., 2016a) that have investigated
the eﬀectiveness of a brief inpatient or residential format.
From both cost-eﬀectiveness and a clinical perspective, it is
important to explore whether a briefer inpatient or residential
treatment format could produce similar results as treatment
formats of longer duration, both at discharge and at a longer
term.
Consequently, the primary aim of this study was to explore
the 6-month eﬀectiveness of a brief psychological (no changes
in medication) inpatient treatment format with duration of
3 weeks. In light of recent research on intensive treatment formats
(e.g., Jónsson et al., 2015), it was hypothesized that obsessivecompulsive symptoms would show a signiﬁcant reduction
from admission to discharge, with some deterioration between
discharge and 6-month follow-up. As a secondary outcome
measure, the outcome pattern of depressive symptoms was
examined; the hypothesis being that depressive symptoms would
show a similar pattern as obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
Third, since the majority of previous studies of inpatient
and residential treatment of OCD see pharmacotherapy as an
integral component of their treatment (e.g., Rufer et al., 2005;
Stewart et al., 2005; Adams et al., 2012), our last aim was to
explore the inﬂuence of antidepressant medication on treatment
outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedure
The sample consisted of 187 consecutively admitted patients
with OCD who were ﬁrst-time admissions to a 3-week inpatient
treatment in a specialized anxiety unit in Norway. Out of these,
166 were treatment completers and 21 (11.2%) were dropouts.
Patients were included in this study if they met DSM-IV criteria
for OCD according to the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule
(ADIS-IV, Brown et al., 1994), and if OCD was considered the
principal diagnosis. The primary reasons for admission to the
specialized inpatient treatment were inadequate response to prior
outpatient treatment and/or presence of severe OCD.
As shown in the participant ﬂow diagram (Figure 1), 427
patients were originally assessed for inclusion in this study.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: no diagnosis of OCD/OCD
not primary diagnosis (n = 118); psychosis (n = 19); patients
assessed as eligible for outpatient treatment rather than inpatient
treatment (n = 23). Forty-ﬁve (19.4%) patients were oﬀered
inpatient treatment, but refused. Furthermore, 35 OCD patients
treated at the clinic were not included in the analysis due
to missing both pre- and post-treatment data. The data was
collected through paper and pencil and internet administration.
All outcome measures were part of the standard quality control
instruments of the health services oﬀered at the inpatient unit.
The medical quality registry was approved by the local Data
Protection Oﬃcial for Research (Reference Number: 12/5755)
and the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research
Ethics (Reference Number: 2010/2883). All subjects gave written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment
The inpatient treatment program for OCD was organized into
separate phases for assessment and treatment. At their ﬁrst
arrival at the unit, the OCD patients went through a thorough
diagnostic evaluation and assessment of suitability for treatment.
This assessment had a duration of 3 to 5 days and was performed
by the therapists at the inpatient unit. In addition to the
diﬀerential diagnostic evaluation where ADIS-IV (Brown et al.,
1994) and several self-report questionnaires (e.g., The ObsessiveCompulsive Inventory-Revised; Foa et al., 2002) were used, a
detailed summary of the patients’ obsessions and compulsions
was made. This was later used as a basis for formulation of the
anxiety hierarchy and designation of exposure exercises.
Another important ingredient in the assessment phase was
psychoeducation concerning anxiety and OCD, as well as
providing a rationale for ERP. The rationale given was not
based on habituation or disconﬁrmation of cognitive beliefs,
but with a main focus on how the exposure exercises should
be conducted. The patients were informed that obsessional
thoughts were normal and without risk, and that OCD
was developed and maintained by strategies with an aim
of controlling obsessional thoughts. An important aim of
treatment was therefore to teach the patients to confront their
obsessional thoughts and feelings in the opposite way, i.e.,
seek out anxiety and discomfort rather than trying to reduce
and/or control it. For learning and motivational purposes,
the patients also tried out a couple of exposure exercises.
In the end of the assessment stay, a 30-min motivational
interview regarding the patients’ treatment motivation was
conducted.
Due to waiting lists, the average time between assessment and
treatment start was 3 months. The treatment phase had 3 weeks
duration with behavioral elements (ERP) as the main ingredient.
Pharmacotherapy in the form of antidepressant medication was
allowed if the dose was maintained unchanged during the 3week treatment phase, whereas use of benzodiazepines was
not permitted. A minority of patients received cognitive (e.g.,
targeting dysfunctional beliefs like perfectionism and intolerance
of uncertainty) or metacognitive (e.g., challenging thoughtfusion beliefs and beliefs about rituals; Wells, 2009) interventions
in addition to ERP. However, as the inpatient treatment program
was not strictly manualized, there is no consistent information
about the relative contribution of cognitive and metacognitive
elements added to ERP.
As previously mentioned, the main treatment intervention
was ERP. Patients performed a minimum of three exposure
exercises per day; one accompanied by personnel, one partially
assisted, and one without assistance. However, most patients
conducted several exposure exercises daily, as full response
prevention was an important aim from day one. An exposure
exercise could last anywhere from 5 min to 1 h, depending on
the issues and needs of the patient. To ensure that the exposure
exercises were carried out in the right way (i.e., chasing anxiety
and discomfort rather than trying to reduce and/or control it), the
patients ﬁlled out behavioral experiment worksheets three times
daily. Prior to exposure training, the patients were to describe
the exposure exercise, what they feared would happen, as well as

which rituals they normally would have used to reduce anxiety.
Subsequent to exposure training, they evaluated the exercise by
answering questions regarding anxiety level (0–100), degree of
belief that anxiety symptoms were dangerous (0–100), degree
of attempts to reduce/control anxiety and discomfort (0–100),
as well as encouraging the patient to think of improvements
(e.g., “What could be done to make the exposure exercise
better?”). If the patients ritualized during an exposure session,
they had to re-expose themselves to the trigger, as well as ﬁlling
out a worksheet to evaluate what went wrong, what could be done
to avoid ritualization in the future etc.
The patients were to reach the top of their exposure hierarchy
within the ﬁrst 1.5 weeks. Thereafter, during the second weekend
in the treatment phase, the patients went home on leave to
practice ERP, with an aim of generalizing and implementing
learning. The exposure tasks that had been experienced as the
most diﬃcult during their leave home became the main focus
of ERP the third and last week of treatment. The patients’
therapy progress was closely monitored by the staﬀ, with
multidisciplinary team meetings 3 days a week. The behavioral
experiment worksheets, registration of deviations from response
prevention, as well as check lists for the staﬀ’s tasks during all

phases of treatment, were also elements that were meant to ensure
treatment structure and adherence to treatment.
Relapse prevention interventions, such as the formulation of
an “old and new plan,” were also an important ingredient in the
third week of treatment. The “old and new plan” is an overview of
how the patients handled their obsessive-compulsive symptoms
previously (e.g., regarding thinking style, behavior, and focus of
attention), as well as what they had learnt regarding overcoming
obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment. Also, relevant
exposure exercises in their home environment were planned. The
patients were oﬀered short phone calls with therapists or milieu
personnel up to 3 weeks after discharge, where they could repeat
treatment rationale and evaluate exposure plans. The frequency
of these phone calls varied depending on the patients’ needs.
Treatment completers were oﬀered an additional 3-day stay at
the inpatient clinic both at 3 and 6 months after discharge, with an
aim of relapse prevention. In this period, interventions from the
treatment phase were repeated. Among treatment completers, the
rates of attendance to the follow-up stays were as follows: 77.2%
at 3-month follow-up and 63.1% at 6-month follow-up. Patients
who did not attend the 3-day follow-up stays were attempted
to be reached by telephone. Therefore, 30 (10.4%) of Y-BOCS’
follow-up interviews were done by telephone.
Therapists
The treatment was provided by a multidisciplinary team
consisting of therapists and various personnel, including nurses,
psychiatric nurses, social workers, and students. One therapist
was assigned as a case supervisor and conducted regular
individual therapy sessions, but the entire staﬀwas involved in
activities in the milieu, such as giving emotional and motivational
support, as well as conducting exposure exercises. A total of
18 therapists were involved during this study’s recruitment
period, and all were trained in diagnosis and treatment of OCD
(i.e., ERP). Thirteen therapists had completed a 2-year course
in cognitive behavioral therapy and/or metacognitive therapy.
There was ongoing supervision by experienced ERP-therapists.
Measures
The inventories were answered before assessment, before
treatment start, at post-treatment, before 3-month follow-up, and
before 6-month follow-up. To examine changes in symptoms of
OCD and depression, the following measures were used:
The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale
The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Goodman et al.,
1989) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale SelfReport (Y-BOCS-SR, Baer et al., 1993) were the primary outcome
measures of this study, as they measure the severity of obsessivecompulsive symptoms. The respondents rated ﬁve aspects of both
obsessions and compulsions: frequency, interference, distress,
resistance, and control. A 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0
(none) to 4 (extreme) was used to rate the responses, where the
range of severity was characterized as follows: 8 – 15 is considered
as mild severity, 16 – 23 as moderate, 24 – 31 as severe, and
32 – 40 as extreme. The psychometrics of the Y-BOCS is well
established (e.g., Steketee et al., 1996; Grabill et al., 2008). In our
study, the interview version was used with the ﬁrst 122 (65.2%)
recruited participants. The self-report Y-BOCS was used with
the last 65 (34.8%) participants when the inpatient unit switched
to electronic assessments. However, there is a strong correlation
between the two versions of Y-BOCS (Steketee et al., 1996). In this
study, the Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcient measured at baseline was
0.80.
The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R, Foa et al.,
2002) is a self-report form that measures severity of obsessivecompulsive symptoms. The OCI-R consists of 18 items reﬂecting
six subscales known as washing, checking, ordering, obsessions,
hoarding, and mental neutralization. A 5-point Likert scale from
0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) was used to rate the responses,
where higher scores indicate more severe obsessive-compulsive
symptoms (Foa et al., 2002). The OCI-R has demonstrated
good reliability, and good convergent and discriminant validity
(e.g., Foa et al., 2002; Abramowitz and Deacon, 2006). The
psychometric properties are also validated in a Norwegian sample
(Solem et al., 2010). In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcient
for the total scale at baseline was 0.83.
The Beck Depression Inventory
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et al., 1961) is a widely
used measure of severity of depressive symptoms. It is a selfreport form with 21 items, where each symptom is rated on
a 4-point Likert scale. The range of severity is characterized
as follows: 10 – 14 is considered as mild severity, 15 – 24
as moderate, 25 – 63 as severe. The BDI is shown to be a
highly reliable and valid measure of depression severity. In Beck
et al. (1988) review of its psychometric properties, the internal
consistency was 0.87, and test–retest reliability was greater than
0.60. Due to a switch into electronic assessment, the ﬁrst 122
patients enrolled in our study answered the BDI, whereas the last
65 respondents answered the newer version, BDI-II (Beck et al.,
1996). However, previous research has found the BDI and BDIII to be strongly correlated (Dozois et al., 1998). The Cronbach’s
alpha value was 0.89 at baseline.
Data Analyses
First, possible diﬀerences in Y-BOCS, OCI-R, and BDI scores due
to diﬀerences in administration mode (paper and pencil versus
internet administration) and variability in the measures used
(Y-BOCS versus Y-BOCS-SR, BDI versus BDI-II) were explored
through independent t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Due to
three comparisons, the critical alpha level was set at 0.02.
Second, to explore whether the inpatient group actually
was diﬀerent from an outpatient group, Pearson’s chi-square
tests and independent t-tests were used to contrast the ﬁnal
sample’s baseline demographic and diagnostic information with
characteristics of the OCD clinic’s outpatient sample from the
same period of time. Furthermore, baseline demographic and
diagnostic characteristics of study dropouts versus treatment
completers were compared using the same statistics.
Not all measurements were available for every patient at
follow-up. Among treatment completers (n = 166), number of

respondents at 3-month follow up was as follows: Y-BOCS:
n = 142; OCI-R: n = 139; BDI: n = 139. Among treatment
completers at 6-month follow-up, number of respondents was
104 for Y-BOCS, 87 for OCI-R, and 86 for BDI. A non-signiﬁcant
Little’s MCAR test revealed that the data was missing completely
at random: χ2(127) = 149.81, p = 0.082 (Little, 1988). Expectation
maximization (EM) analysis was used to estimate the means and
standard deviations for missing data at follow-up among the
treatment completers. For each of the three scales, the available
items from each wave of data were used in the calculations,
i.e., the available items from assessment, pre-treatment, posttreatment, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. For those
with premature discharges (dropouts: n = 21), the last completed
assessment was used in the analysis (via a last-observationcarried-forward-approach). Thus, an intention-to-treat (ITT)
methodology was used in this study.
Treatment outcome data were analyzed using one-way
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). No inﬂuential
outliers were found, as measured by Cook’s distance. However,
Mauchly’s test of sphericity indicated that the assumption of
sphericity had been violated in the outcome variables: Y-BOCS:
χ2(9) = 242.5, p = 0.001; OCI-R: χ2(9) = 281.7, p = 0.001;
BDI: χ2(9) = 234.4, p = 0.001. Therefore, Greenhouse–Geisser
corrected tests were reported. Eﬀect sizes were reported as
partial eta squared (η2
p), where values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14 are
considered to reﬂect small, medium, and large eﬀects, respectively
(Cohen, 1988).
As an additional measure of treatment eﬀectiveness, the
within-subject eﬀect-sizes for changes in obsessive-compulsive
and depressive symptoms were calculated with Cohens d,
correcting for related means by using the equation by Morris and
DeShon (2002). An eﬀect size of 0.20 – 0.49 is considered small,
0.50 – 0.79 as moderate, and ≥0.80 as large.
To
examine
whether
changes
in
obsessive-compulsive
symptoms were clinically meaningful, clinically signiﬁcant
change analyses were carried out on Y-BOCS and OCI-R scores
at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. The international
consensus criteria for Y-BOCS (Mataix-Cols et al., 2016) were
chosen as the primary clinically signiﬁcant change estimate,
where treatment response is operationalized as a ≥35% reduction
in Y-BOCS scores and a partial treatment response as a ≥25%
but < 35% reduction. Remission is deﬁned as having a Y-BOCS
score ≤12.
Since inconsistencies in how treatment response are deﬁned
in clinical trials have been shown to lead to diﬀerent estimates
of treatment eﬃcacy and relapse rates (Simpson et al., 2005),
Fisher and Wells’ (2005) criteria were included as an additional
clinical signiﬁcance change measure on Y-BOCS scores. Thus,
the proportion of patients who (1) recover, (2) make statistically
reliable improvement, and (3) remain unchanged were calculated.
To meet criteria of recovery, the patients needed a score of 14
points or less, as well as a reliable change index (RCI) of minimum
10 points change following treatment. To achieve “statistically
reliable improvement,” only the RCI criteria of minimum 10
points change applied. The proportion of patients that had a posttreatment and 6-month follow-up score at or below the cut-oﬀ
(≤14) was also calculated.
In the clinically signiﬁcant change analysis on OCI-R
scores, the same classiﬁcation of recovery, statistically reliable
improvement, and no change, was used. Similar criteria as used
by Solem et al. (2009) were applied, with a cut-oﬀscore of 21 and
RCI of 12.
The potential inﬂuence of antidepressant use on treatment
outcome was investigated using independent t-tests, where the
Y-BOCS post-treatment and 6-month scores of antidepressant
users versus non-users were contrasted. In addition, the
impact of antidepressant dose was explored using the World
Health Organization’s (World Health Organization Collaborating
Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology [WHO], 2015) “deﬁned
daily doses” (DDD) methodology. Each patients’ antidepressant
dose was converted into a DDD-score, where all DDD’s were
based on the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre
for Drug Statistics Methodology [WHO] (2015) guidelines. To
explore the relationship between dose and Y-BOCS treatment
outcome, correlational analyses of Y-BOCS post-treatment and
6-month scores and DDD-scores were conducted.
Lastly, a logistic regression analysis was used to explore
predictors of relapse at 6-month follow-up. Relapse was deﬁned
using Mataix-Cols et al.’s (2016) criteria; the patient initially
classiﬁed as being in remission (i.e., a Y-BOCS score of 12 or
lower), but no longer met this criteria at follow-up. The patients’
relapse status (relapse versus remained in remission) was entered
as the dependent variable, whereas gender, age, marital status
(single vs. married/cohabitant), pre-treatment Y-BOCS and BDI
scores, and attendance to the follow-up stay 3 months after
discharge were entered as predictor variables. Multicollinearity
did not appear as a problem with any of the predictor variables,
with VIF ranging from 1.03 – 1.28 and tolerance from 0.78 to
0.98. No inﬂuential observations were found (measured by Cook’s
distance, leverage, and the standardized residuals).
RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
The data was collected through both paper and pencil (n = 122
at baseline) and internet administration (n = 65 at baseline).
Independent t-tests showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the two administration modes at baseline, neither in Y-BOCS
scores, t(185) = 0.48, p = 0.634, OCI-R scores, t(185) = −0.05,
p = 0.957, nor BDI scores, t(93.5) = −1.42, p = 0.160.
Participant Characteristics
A description of the ﬁnal sample’s baseline demographic
and diagnostic information is provided in Table 1. Their
characteristics are contrasted with characteristics of the same
clinic’s outpatient OCD sample from the same time period.
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two samples were found,
indicating higher severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and
life impairment in the inpatient sample. The inpatients were
older, reported more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and
lower rates of employment/student status. Also, the inpatients
had a more extensive treatment history and used more
antidepressant medication.

As Veale et al. (2016a) pointed out, there is a wide variety
between previous inpatient and residential studies regarding
admission criteria and sample characteristics. The current sample
may be diﬀerent from some of the previous samples, as there
was no ﬁxed admission criteria regarding Y-BOCS severity,
whereas studies like Boschen et al. (2010) and Veale et al. (2016a)
had an inclusion criterion of Y-BOCS ≥30. In addition, the
current inpatient service had no criteria regarding the number
of previously failed treatments, even though most of the patients
had previous treatment attempts for OCD (see Table 1). A third
distinction is related to economy. The stay at the inpatient unit
was ﬁnanced by the national health care system in Norway (i.e.,
not self-payed or covered by private insurance providers). Thus,
the inpatient service may have been more accessible in Norway as
compared to other countries. However, despite these diﬀerences,
the mean pre-treatment Y-BOCS from the 19 studies described
in Veale et al. (2016b) is similar to scores in the current study
(see Figure 2). The studies with the lowest (Kuelz et al., 2006)
and highest (Boschen et al., 2010) mean pre-treatment Y-BOCS
in Veale et al. (2016b) are also displayed.
Comparison of Treatment Completers
and Dropouts
As shown in Table 2, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was identiﬁed
between completers (n = 166) and dropouts (n = 21) with respect
to Y-BOCS, OCI-R, and BDI severity measured at baseline.
However, signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found regarding gender,
χ2(1,N = 187) = 12.57, p = 0.001, and prior inpatient treatment,
χ2(1,N = 187) = 6.45, p = 0.011. Among dropouts, there was a
higher proportion of males and higher percentage participants
with previous inpatient treatment.
Treatment Effectiveness
Assessment, admission, discharge, and follow-up scores for the
Y-BOCS, the OCI-R, and the BDI are presented in Table 3.
Means and standard deviations are reported for each measure for
treatment completers and the ITT sample.
The results of the repeated measures ANOVA showed
a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of time on Y-BOCS outcome,
F(2.6,476.2) = 306.0, p = 0.001, η2
p = 0.62. Post hoc tests with
Bonferroni correction showed a small, but signiﬁcant decrease
in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from assessment phase to
treatment start (p = 0.014), as well as a signiﬁcant decrease
from treatment start to discharge (p = 0.001). The data further
indicated an increase in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from
discharge to 3-months follow-up (p = 0.001), followed by
stability in symptom severity between 3-month and 6-month
follow-up (p = 0.989). On average, this represented a 52%
decrease in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from assessment
to discharge, and a 36% decrease from assessment to 6-month
follow-up.
The analysis was repeated with OCI-R as measure of
obsessive-compulsive symptoms. With the exception of a nonsigniﬁcant decrease between assessment phase and treatment
start (p = 0.061), the same pattern in symptom changes emerged.
Overall, there was a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of time on
obsessive-compulsive symptoms, F(2.2,403.6) = 240.4, p = 0.001,
η2
p = 0.68. Post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction showed
a signiﬁcant decrease in symptoms between assessment and
discharge (p = 0.001), a signiﬁcant increase in symptoms between
discharge and 3-month follow-up, (p = 0.001), followed by
stability in symptom level between 3- and 6-month followup (p = 0.999). This represented, on average, a decrease of
56% in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from assessment to
discharge, and a decrease of 42% from assessment to 6-month
follow-up.
Regarding
depressive
symptoms,
the
outcome
pattern
was similar to obsessive-compulsive symptoms. There was a
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of time on depressive symptoms,
as measured with the BDI, F(2.5,465.1) = 112.4, p = 0.001,
η2
p = 0.55. Post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction showed a
non-signiﬁcant decrease in symptoms between assessment phase
and treatment start (p = 0.170) and a signiﬁcant decrease in
symptoms between assessment phase and discharge (p = 0.001).
Furthermore, there was a signiﬁcant increase in symptoms
between discharge and 3-month follow-up (p = 0.001), followed
by stability in symptom level between 3- and 6-month follow-up
(p = 0.999). On average, this represented a 53% decrease in
depressive symptoms from assessment to discharge, and a 35%
decrease from assessment to 6-month follow-up.
The within-subject eﬀect-sizes for changes in obsessivecompulsive and depressive symptoms are presented in Table 3.
The eﬀect sizes from assessment phase to discharge, as well
as assessment phase to follow-up, were large for obsessivecompulsive symptoms and moderate to large for depressive
symptoms. See Figure 3 for a comparison of eﬀect size estimates
from the current study and the meta-analysis of 19 inpatient and
residential treatment programs using CBT for OCD (Veale et al.,
2016b). The comparison showed that the ITT group’s eﬀect size

from assessment phase to discharge was similar to the eﬀect size

had a higher eﬀect size estimate.
Clinically Signiﬁcant Change
Following Mataix-Cols et al.’s (2016) criteria, the Y-BOCS
results for the ITT group at post-treatment were as follows:

79.7% were classiﬁed as treatment responders, 5.3% as partial
responders, 57.8% met criteria for remission, whereas 15% had
no change in symptoms. At 6-month follow-up, 61.5% were
classiﬁed as treatment responders and 8.0% as partial responders.
A proportion of 34.2% met criteria for remission, whereas 30.5%
had no change in symptoms.
Variability in how treatment response was deﬁned did lead
to diﬀerent estimates of treatment eﬃcacy and relapse rates.
Following Fisher and Wells’ (2005) clinically signiﬁcant change
criteria for Y-BOCS scores, 71.1% of treatment completers
and 63.1% of the ITT group were classiﬁed as recovered
at post-treatment. Similar results were found for OCI-R
scores; 65.6% of treatment completers and 58.2% of the
ITT sample met criteria for recovery at discharge. At 6month follow-up, 35.3 – 40.1% of the ITT sample were
classiﬁed as recovered, whereas an additional proportion
of 10.7 – 12.8% were classiﬁed as signiﬁcantly improved,
as measured by OCI-R and Y-BOCS. See Table 4 for a
summary of the results from the clinically signiﬁcant change
analyses.
Inﬂuence of Antidepressant Use
At baseline, 54% of the sample reported use of antidepressant
medication (mainly SSRI’s). The most frequently used were
Cipralex (n = 29) and Zoloft (n = 21), followed by Anafranil,
Seroxat, and Fluoxetin (each with n = 7). Regarding dose, 60%
were higher than the drug’s DDD, 35% were at the level of
the recommended DDD, whereas 5% were below the DDD.
A proportion of 76% held dose levels unchanged during the whole
treatment phase. Before treatment start, 4% reduced the dose and
9% stopped using anti-depressants. Between post-treatment and
6 months follow-up, 1% reduced the dose and 11% stopped using
antidepressants.

Predictors of Relapse
A logistic regression analysis was used to explore predictors of
relapse at 6-month follow-up. Patients who relapsed following
discharge comprised 28.9% of the sample (n = 54). Pre-treatment
levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Y-BOCS) emerged as
the only signiﬁcant predictor of relapse, B = 0.17, SE = 0.06,
p = 0.003. Each unit increase in Y-BOCS severity at pre-treatment
was associated with an increase in the odds of relapse by a
factor of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.06 – 1.33). Neither gender (B = 0.44,
SE = 0.46, p = 0.347), age (B = −0.02, SE = 0.02, p = 0.262),
marital status (B = 0.36, SE = 0.47, p = 0.443), pre-treatment
levels of depression (B = −0.01, SE = 0.02, p = 0.624), nor
attendance to the 3-day follow-up stay 3 months after discharge
(B = 0.31, SE = 0.52, p = 0.546) emerged as signiﬁcant predictors
of relapse.
DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst study investigating the long-term outcome
of a 3-week inpatient treatment for OCD. Consistent with
this study’s hypothesis, the results indicated that the treatment
delivered was eﬀective. At discharge, 79.7% of the patients

Results are displayed in percentages. For Y-BOCS, Mataix-Cols et al.’s (2016) criteria are reported as the primary clinically signiﬁcant change estimate, whereas the
criteria recommended by Fisher and Wells (2005) are included as an additional change measure. The criteria by Fisher and Wells (2005) are listed in parentheses. For
OCI-R, similar criteria as used by Solem et al. (2009) were applied. Y-BOCS, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale; OCI-R, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised;
ITT, intent-to-treat sample.
were classiﬁed as treatment responders regarding obsessivecompulsive symptoms. The dropout rate was low (11.2%),
indicating that the treatment was considered acceptable for
most patients. There was an increase in obsessive-compulsive
symptoms from post-treatment to 3-month follow-up, followed
by stability in symptom severity between 3 and 6 months. At 6month follow-up, 61.5% of the patients showed a full treatment
response, indicating that some patients were still unchanged
or had relapsed. The outcome pattern of depressive symptoms
was similar to obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Antidepressant
use appeared not to inﬂuence the outcome. Only pre-treatment
level of obsessive-compulsive symptoms emerged as a signiﬁcant
predictor of relapse.
Compared to previous studies of inpatient and residential
treatment for OCD (e.g., Kordon et al., 2005; Stewart et al.,
2005; Veale et al., 2016a), where the majority report treatment
durations of 2–3 months, the current study displays a similar
treatment eﬀect at discharge. In the meta-analysis of residential
and inpatient OCD treatment, Veale et al. (2016b) found a mean
reduction in Y-BOCS scores from baseline to post-treatment at
10.7 points, whereas the mean reduction score in the ITT-sample
in our study was 12.5. This indicates that a brief inpatient format
can produce a similar post-treatment result as inpatient formats
of longer duration.
Despite very encouraging post-treatment results, there was
some relapse at follow-up. Overall, the current changes in
obsessive-compulsive symptoms from assessment phase to 6month follow-up showed large eﬀect sizes, but the results
indicated an increase in obsessive-compulsive symptoms from
post-treatment to 3-month follow-up, followed by stability
in symptom severity between 3-month and 6-month followup. The results of previous inpatient and residential studies
reporting long-term outcomes are inconsistent, with some
studies reporting the gains to be stable (e.g., Kordon et al., 2005;
Rufer et al., 2005; Stewart et al., 2009), whereas some found
a slight deterioration (McKenzie and Marks, 2003; Veale
et al., 2016a). One explanation for the diﬀerential results
may be methodological, as the heterogeneity in treatment and
populations among the studies who report follow-up data is
large. With the exception of Veale et al. (2016a, N = 124
at Y-BOCS at 6–12 months follow-up), most of the previous
inpatient and residential treatment studies reporting follow-up
data had small sample sizes (range of N: 16 – 44) and/or low
response rates. In comparison, a strength of our study is a
sample size of 142 at 3-month follow-up (i.e., 86% of treatment
completers) and 104 at 6-month follow-up (i.e., 63% of treatment
completers).
Furthermore, the diﬀerent symptom trends at follow-up
between studies might be explained by diﬀerences in treatment
duration. The increase in symptoms at 3-month follow-up
is in line with the meta-analytic ﬁndings of Jónsson et al.
(2015), suggesting that there could be more relapse in patients
receiving intensive treatment. Jónsson et al. (2015) compared
treatment eﬀects of intensive outpatient CBT with standard
weekly CBT. They found a signiﬁcantly larger post-treatment
eﬀect in the intensive treatment condition, but this diﬀerence
was no longer present at 3-month follow-up. According to
Jónsson et al. (2015), this was mainly due to some deterioration
among patients in the intensive CBT-formats. The higher
relapse rate in intensive treatment conditions may be due to
fewer opportunities to consolidate and generalize the learning
to the patients’ home environment. Craske et al. (2008)
recommend spacing of exposure trials, as well as a lot of
variability throughout exposure, to enhance the accessibility and
retrievability of learning. In our study, the majority of patients
were not settled near-by the inpatient unit. The leave home
(one weekend during the treatment phase) was designed to
address the issues of variability and generalizing learning, but one
weekend may have been too short to consolidate this learning
suﬃciently.

Brief Inpatient Treatment of OCD
In general, there is a need for more research to clarify
the relative long-term eﬀectiveness of intensive versus standard
treatment formats in both inpatient and outpatient treatment
settings, as well as further research into how to maintain the good
post-treatment eﬀects of the brief and intensive format. Use of
controlled trials with large samples yielding high response rates
at follow-up are recommended.
As hypothesized, depressive symptoms demonstrated a similar
outcome pattern as obsessive-compulsive symptoms. There was
a signiﬁcant decrease in symptoms between pre-treatment and
post-treatment, an increase between post-treatment and 3-month
follow-up, followed by stability in symptoms between 3-month
and 6-month follow-up. Overall, this resulted in a 35% decrease
in depressive symptoms from pre-treatment to follow-up. These
results are in line with previous studies examining depressive
symptoms during inpatient and residential treatment for OCD
(e.g., Stewart et al., 2009; Veale et al., 2016a). As Stewart et al.
(2009) also pointed out - whether the improvement in depressive
symptoms is primary or secondary to reduction in obsessivecompulsive symptoms, or whether the change occurred in
both symptom types simultaneously, is unknown. Nevertheless,
improvement from depressive symptoms is of clinical relevance,
as comorbid depression severity has been found to contribute to
poor quality of life (e.g., Masellis et al., 2003) and occupational
disability (e.g., Mancebo et al., 2008).
Approximately half of the sample used antidepressant
medication during treatment, but antidepressant use appeared
not to inﬂuence the outcome. There was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in Y-BOCS post-treatment and 6-month score
between antidepressant users and non-users. Also, there was
no relationship between dose and Y-BOCS treatment outcome.
These results are in line with previous studies examining
the inﬂuence of antidepressant medication on OCD inpatient
treatment outcome (e.g., Kordon et al., 2005; Rufer et al., 2005;
Langner et al., 2009). In a 2-year follow-up study of 74 inpatients
with OCD, Kordon et al. (2005) found CBT and combined
therapy (CBT + serotonin-reuptake inhibitors treatment) to
be equally eﬀective both at post-treatment and follow-up.
Furthermore, no diﬀerences in the obsessive-compulsive scores
were observed between those who continued antidepressant
medication and those who discontinued.
Only pre-treatment level of obsessive-compulsive symptoms
emerged as a signiﬁcant predictor of relapse. Neither gender, age,
marital status, pre-treatment levels of depression, nor attendance
to the follow-up stay 3 months after discharge emerged as
signiﬁcant predictors of relapse. The results are not in accordance
with the results of Stewart et al. (2009), where patients who
relapsed were found to be signiﬁcantly more likely to be living
alone. However, the results are in line with Knopp et al. (2013)
systematic review of predictors of response to psychological
therapies in OCD, as they found OCD symptom severity as one
of the few variables that was relatively consistently related to
outcome.
Limitations
Due to the naturalistic design of the study, there were no
independent raters of diagnostic information at baseline, and
there was no control group. The lack of control group may
give a false impression of eﬃciency. However, spontaneous
recovery from OCD is rare. In addition, as the inpatient treatment
program was not strictly manualized, there is no consistent
information about the relative contribution of cognitive and
metacognitive elements added to ERP.
Inevitably, data from large service evaluations are likely to
have missing data, which can bias the eﬀect of treatment on
response. The analysis adjusted for missing data at follow-up by
using EM and LOCF as imputation strategies and therefore has to
be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, there was variability in
the measures used, as both the self-report and interview versions
of the Y-BOCS were used. Similarly, for ratings of depressive
symptoms, the ﬁrst included patients used BDI, while the others
used BDI-II. However, the BDI and the BDI-II are strongly
correlated (Dozois et al., 1998), as are Y-BOCS and Y-BOCSSR (Steketee et al., 1996). In the current study, there were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in baseline scores between Y-BOCS and
Y-BOCS-SR or between BDI and BDI-II.
Another limitation concerns follow-up assessment. The
diagnostic status of OCD was not re-evaluated. Inclusion of
other potentially clinically important indicators of treatment
outcome such as anxiety and functional outcomes across multiple
settings (e.g., home, work, social life) would have improved
the study. Given that OCD is associated with impaired quality
of life and functioning (Asnaani et al., 2017), inclusion of an
inventory such as EuroQol (EuroQol-Group, 1990) could have
brought information regarding how changes in OCD severity
are associated with changes in functioning and quality of life.
Measurement of the use of outpatient care after discharge, as well
as an analysis of the cost-eﬀectiveness of the inpatient treatment,
would also have improved the study. Finally, what happens with
their obsessive-compulsive symptoms after 6 months remains
unknown.
CONCLUSION
The current study’s inpatient unit for OCD was established
in 2008. At the time, evidence-based treatments of OCD
(i.e., ERP and CBT) were diﬃcult to get in Norway due to
few available ERP specialists. Therefore, the 3-week inpatient
program was originally established as a practical arrangement
to handle referrals from the whole country. However, there
was an explicit wish to establish local specialized OCD-teams
that could carry through the OCD-treatment closer to people’s
homes and in a more cost-eﬀective way. This resulted in the
national implementation of OCD treatment in Norway and the
establishment of 30 specialized OCD-teams (Kvale and Hansen,
2014).
As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst study to look at the
eﬀectiveness of a brief (3 weeks) version of inpatient treatment
in such a large sample size, combined with long-term followup data with good response rates. This study replicates previous
ﬁndings concerning inpatient and residential treatment being
an eﬀective treatment format (e.g., Stewart et al., 2005, 2009;
Veale et al., 2016a) for severe OCD, and extends these results

Brief Inpatient Treatment of OCD
to a brief version of inpatient treatment. However, the increase
in symptoms between post-treatment and 3-month follow-up
underlines the need for further research into predictors of relapse
in inpatient and residential treatment, as well as further research
into how to maintain the good post-treatment eﬀects of the brief
and intensive format. One possibility may be booster sessions
delivered by video chatting applications (Vogel et al., 2014).
