Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common behavioral disorder 
among adolescents and children. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are 
the first pharmacological choice for this condition due to mild adverse effect profile.
Objective: This systematic review was performed to evaluate the efficacy of SSRI for 
OCD in adolescents and children.
Methods: Search terms were entered into PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, and 
Google Scholar. The included studies were randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 
SSRIs conducted in populations of children and adolescents younger than 18 years. 
Change from baseline Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), 
end-treatment CY-BOCS with respective SD, and response and remission rates were 
collected for continuous and dichotomous outcome assessment, respectively. Cochrane 
Rev Man software was used for meta-analyses, providing Forest plots where applicable.
Results: SSRIs were superior to placebo with a small effect size. There was no additional 
benefit of combination treatment over cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone, but CBT 
added substantial benefit to SSRI monotherapy. Fluoxetine and sertraline appear to be 
superior to fluvoxamine.
Conclusion: The results of current systematic review and meta-analysis support the 
existing National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for choosing 
CBT as first line of treatment and substituting it with SSRI, depending on patient 
SSRI for Treatment of OCD in Adolescents and Children

INTRODUCTION
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic debilitating 
condition that is associated with recurrent and persistent thoughts 
and the compulsions to suppress them with certain excessive 
and repetitive behaviors. For about half of the diagnosed cases, 
the onset of OCD takes place in childhood or adolescence (1). 
Compared with adults, children are more likely to demonstrate 
the evolution of clinical manifestations and the symptoms wax 
and wane as they grow (2, 3).
Currently, the diagnosis is based on internationally accepted 
classification systems, namely Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders in its fifth edition (DSM 5) in the United 
States and, less frequently, ICD 10 criteria elsewhere. In addition 
to diagnosing, the severity of the condition is assessed and 
documented using validated scales, such as Children’s YaleBrown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) for children and 
adolescents, which is a modification of the original Yale-Brown 
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) used for adults.
Medications and psychotherapy or a combination of both are 
commonly used to treat patients with OCD. The only currently 
available treatment options for OCD are either medication 
or psychotherapy or the combination thereof (4, 5), the latter 
being chosen for more severe, refractory to treatment and 
comorbid cases.
Treatment with clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant 
(TCA) that inhibits reuptake of serotonin, was the first option 
demonstrated to be effective at reducing OCD symptoms (6), 
and this was later confirmed in a 2003 meta-analysis (7) for the 
pediatric population. Although clomipramine is an effective 
option, it cannot be used as a first-line agent for treating OCD in 
children and adolescents due to its overburdened adverse effect 
profile (8, 9). Although it most commonly causes a combination 
of minor cholinergic symptoms, such as sedation, bothersome 
xerostomia, constipation, and urinary retention, and even 
more, severe events like seizures and cardiovascular effects, 
such as orthostatic hypotension, tachy- and bradyarrhythmias, 
ventricular fibrillation, and prolonged QT are well documented. 
In some of the devastating cases, sudden cardiac death in youth 
is attributed to such effects. Thus, a better tolerated and safer 
alternative has been sought to replace clomipramine as the more 
appropriate pharmaceutical candidate. The selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) seem to efficiently fill in that role.
Approved by the FDA at the end of 1978, fluoxetine (Prozac) 
was the first agent marketed as an SSRI, and its use has once and 
for all established the role of serotonin (5-HT) in the pathogenesis 
of psychiatric disorders. SSRIs were in many aspects’ superior 
to the pre-existing classes of anti-depressants, i.e., TCAs and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Being selective in 
nature of their action, SSRIs had a much more favorable sideeffect profile (especially regarding that of arrhythmias and QT 
prolongation which were absent with the latter agents), easier 
dose titration, remarkable margin of safety when considering 
overdoses, and thus overall were better tolerated and adhered to 
by the populations with psychiatric and mood disorders (10).
A meta-analysis suggested clomipramine to be more effective 
compared with SSRI for the treatment of OCD in children (11). 
That said, direct comparisons of clomipramine and SSRI have 
not shown any superiority for any of the two drugs for treating 
OCD in adults (12–15). There has not been a single study 
comparing clomipramine to SSRI in a head to head design for 
treating OCD in children, and the claims of the former being 
more efficacious than the latter cannot be given considerable 
weight until proven otherwise.
The commonly held opinion is that cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) should be the first line of treatment for OCD in 
children and adolescents. This approach has also been endorsed 
by the existing clinical guidelines (16, 17) and has a considerable 
base of evidence. A systematic review of 13 randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) assessing the treatment options for OCD (18) 
pointed out to the place and efficacy of CBT for the management 
of OCD in children and adolescents, but the comparisons were 
made to waitlist and placebo treatment, and not to other available 
active options.
Thus, the current role of SSRIs in managing OCD in 
adolescents and children remains at least under-investigated. 
We have undertaken this review to address some of the gaps 
concerning SSRI treatment, as described more thoroughly below.
To be familiar with the ground of research on OCD treatment, 
the reader is humbly referred to the previously conducted 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerning the abovementioned issues (7, 11, 19–23).
THE RATIONALE FOR THIS REVIEW
The current systematic review was undertaken for the following 
reasons. There have been a number of both remote and recent 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses on various treatment 
options for OCD in adolescents and children (see above), 
including CBT, SRI, and the combination thereof, but none 
has specifically addressed the role of SSRIs, and comparisons 
between different SSRIs are lacking as well. Thus, we have decided 
to review the existing literature regarding treatments that utilize 
preference. Adding CBT to current SSRI treatment is effective for non-responders and 
partial responders, but adding SSRI to ongoing CBT does not prove beneficial. The SSRIs 
have different effectiveness, and their relative efficacy remains to be investigated.

only SSRIs as the medication of intervention for treatment of 
OCD in adolescents and children.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The purpose of the current systematic review and meta-analysis 
was to investigate the efficacy of SSRIs in forms of monotherapy 
or in combination treatment with CBT for the management of 
OCD in adolescents and children and compare the effectiveness 
of different SSRIs.
METHODS
Search for Publications
The authors (AK and VK) searched the PubMed, PsycINFO, 
Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases using the 
following keywords: (“treatment” OR “therapy” OR “SSRI” OR 
“Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors” OR “sertraline” or 
“fluoxetine” OR “fluvoxamine “ OR “paroxetine” OR “citalopram” 
OR “escitalopram”) AND (“OCD” OR “obsessive compulsive 
disorder” OR “obsessional compulsive disorder”) AND (“children” 
OR “adolescents”), for citations from first available index date to 
January 1, 2018. The authors also manually searched the references 
from relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses for additional 
citations that could have been missed through the initial search.
Two authors (AK and SD) then independently screened the 
titles and abstracts for the exclusion of irrelevant studies. The full 
papers were then obtained to verify for inclusion eligibility. At 
each step, the results were compared between the researchers and 
any discrepancies were handled with means of discussion. Any 
disagreements were resolved by involving the third independent 
author (RA).
Eligibility for Inclusion
The studies were included if they successfully fulfilled any of the 
following criteria:
1.	 Participants were 18 years or younger
2.	 Participants had a primary diagnosis of OCD
3.	 SSRIs, such as escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, 
sertraline, vilazodone, and citalopram, were used
4.	 OCD symptom severity was reported via appropriate 
psychometric scale, i.e., CY-BOCS
5.	 RCTs
6.	 Studies published in English
Data Synthesis
Change from baseline CY-BOCS, end-treatment CY-BOCS, 
and remission and response rates was compared for different 
interventions arms. Cochrane’s Review Manager software was used 
to perform effect size calculations via random effects model, and 
standard mean differences (SMDs) were presented for continuous 
and in odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes, respectively. 
Forest plots and corresponding mean differences were presented in 
the figures and tables, where appropriate. A subgroup comparison 
was attempted for different SSRIs using the I2 statistic in generic 
inverse variance analysis.
RESULTS
Search Results
The search of databases produced 3,429 results. Following the 
exclusion of duplicates, another 2,241 studies were excluded 
during the title and abstract screening. This resulted in 136 
articles, the full paper texts of which were retrieved and reviewed. 
The search through citations did not reveal any additional relevant 
sources. Twelve articles, which met the inclusion criteria, were 
eventually included (Figure 1).
Characteristics of Included Studies
We have included 12 RCTs (published from 1992 to 2015) in our 
systematic review with a total number of 958 patients. Patients’ 
age ranged from 6 to 18 years with reported means ranging 
from 11 ± 3 to 15 ± 2.4 years. Two studies (18, 24) implemented 
Independent Medical Examination (IME), and seven studies 
used intention to treat (ITT) analysis. Only three studies (25–27) 
did not proceed with the ITT method due to high rate of trial 
completion (92.9%, 100%, and 97.5%, respectively). The pre-trial 
treatment of participants was markedly heterogeneous, wherever 
reported. One of the trials was of a crossover design (25), and 
only data extracted from initial 8 weeks were included in this 
review (the second phase had marked dropout rates). One study 
(28) directly (without a placebo arm) compared the two SSRIs 
(fluoxetine versus citalopram), and the extracted data were only 
used for evaluating the efficacy of different SSRIs.
All included studies reported primary outcome measures using 
CY-BOCS or calculations based on it. Ten studies reported rates 
of response to treatment, the definition of which varied across 
studies: 4, 2, and 1 studies defined response as 25%, 30%, and 40% 
decrease from baseline CY-BOCS, respectively, one study used endtreatment CY-BOCS ≤16 as a definition, and in only one report 
(29) the authors did not specify their definition albeit reported a 
rate. The rationale for combining such heterogenous dichotomous 
outcomes in a meta-analysis was that patients qualifying for a 
larger percent reduction (e.g., 40%) also simultaneously qualify 
for lesser percent reductions (e.g., 25% or 30%); thus one could 
be considering all “responding” patients to at least qualify for the 
least reported percent reduction. Three studies reported rates for 
CY-BOCS ≤11, which was defined as remission in all three. One 
study (26) did not specifically report the above-mentioned rates, 
but the raw data were included in the published article, which 
allowed appropriate calculations to be made.
Altogether 39.5% of patients involved in the 12 RCTs 
responded to all forms of treatment (intervention and placebo) 
as defined by the variety of numerical cutoffs (25%, 30%, and 
40% CY-BOCS reduction, CY-BOCS ≤16 and not otherwise 
specified), and 6.4% were considered to have achieved remission 
(as defined by CY-BOCS ≤11). The characteristics of included 
studies and their participants are presented in further detail in 
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Table 3 presents the risk of bias 
assessments across all included studies.

Since the meta-analyses performed in this review included less 
than 10 studies (see SSRI vs. placebo, N = 7) and were constructed 
on random effects model, funnel plots, and trim and fill analyses 
[see Refs. (34, 35)] would not be useful to assess publication bias. 
Instead, the file drawer phenomenon was recognized, and the 
possibility of publication bias was tested via Orwin’s fail-safe N 
formula [see below and Ref. (36)].

Because the only meta-analysis performed in this review that 
utilizes change from baseline for comparison was that for SSRI 
vs. placebo, the decision was made to calculate Nfs only with 
data from that analysis. The other analyses in this review used 
end-treatment scores for comparison, which by far is not the 
most appropriate manner of demonstrating effect size and is not 
recommended by Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews 
of Interventions (version 5.1.0).
However, the following values were inserted into the formula 
above: N0 = 7, d0 = −0.43, dc = 0.2 (since the effect size of the 
analysis, by the rule of thumb, was designated as small), and 
dfs = 0.
The calculation followed that Nfs = 8 studies with reported 
CY-BOCS standardized mean difference of 0.2 (small effect size, 
opposite direction) were required to bring the current SMD from 
−0.43 to 0.
COMPARISONS
Monotherapy With SSRI Versus Placebo
There were seven RCTs comparing SSRIs with placebo treatment 
included in our review. One of them (25) was conducted in a 
crossover fashion and only data from the first phase (first 8 
weeks) of the study were extracted and analyzed. The reason for 
this decision was that after the crossover, 50% of initially enrolled 
patients dropped out for reasons such as recurrence of symptoms 
after switching to placebo, and the sample size became too small. 
For similar reasons and also to yield homogenous treatment 
durations only data from the “acute phase” (i.e., the first 8 weeks) 
of another study (29) were incorporated into our analysis (the 
study also presented data from a later “maintenance phase,” 
which lasted for another 8 weeks and was performed with only 
participants who were responders). Another study (4) compared 
four intervention arms (SSRI, CBT, SSRI + CBT, placebo), 
from which we included the data for SSRI and placebo into our 
analysis. Overall, we analyzed data on a total number of 725 
patients, 51.6% and 48.4% of which received SSRI and placebo, 
respectively. All studies except one (4) either reported data on 
mean and SD of change from baseline CY-BOCS or presented 
other valuable data (t, p, baseline, end-treatment scores), and 
the change and SD were calculated in the following manner: the 
available values were entered into Rev Man Software’s built-in 
calculator, which returned the desirable measures. The mean 
differences and their pooled analysis are shown in Table 4.

The studies demonstrated effect sizes (SMD) ranging from small 
(−0.28, 95% CI, −0.9 to 0.3) to moderate (−0.75; 95% CI, −1.9 to 
0.4), and the pooled analysis achieved a small effect size of −0.43 
(95% CI, −0.6 to −0.3), which was significant (see Figure  2), 
favoring SSRI. The subgroup analysis did not demonstrate any 
difference between different SSRIs. The subgroups of sertraline, 
fluoxetine, and other SSRIs (paroxetine and fluvoxamine) all 
achieved similar small pooled effect sizes of −0.45 (95% CI, −0.73 
to −0.21), −0.45 (95% CI, −0.78 to −0.12), and −0.40 (95% CI, 
−0.62 to −0.18), respectively, which did not differ significantly 
(Chi2 = 0.18, df = 2 (P = 0.91), I2 = 0%).
Five studies also reported response rates, and one study 
reported remission rates based on various definitions (see above 
and Table 5). The pooled ln OR for response rate was 0.8 (95% 
CI, 0.5–1.1), which converts to SMD of 0.5, 95% CI 0.2, 0.8, p < 
0.05 (37) yielding a significant moderate effect size and favoring 
SSRI (37).
Monotherapy With SSRI Versus CBT
We have identified three RCTs comparing these two treatment 
modalities, all utilizing sertraline. In one study where the author’s 
randomized patients to either SSRI or CBT (18), all patients 
were pre-treated with CBT for 13 weeks before randomization, 
and thus switching to SSRI was compared to continued CBT 
over 16 weeks duration. Another study compared group CBT 
(GCBT) and SSRI treatment during 12 weeks (27). The third 
study (4), as mentioned above, separately compared three 
intervention arms with placebo. Data extracted from the SSRI 
and CBT arms were used for comparison. The SDs of change 
from baseline were not available for all three studies; thus,

compared with regard to their response and remission rates 
(see Table 6). Asbahr et al. and Skarphedinsson et al. reported 
response rates as defined by 25% and 30% reductions from 
baseline CY-BOCS scores, respectively (18, 27). The ln OR for 
the two studies were –0.7 (95% CI, –3.2 to 1.7) and 0.4 (95% CI 
–0.7 to 1.5), respectively. The combined ln OR was 0.2 (95% CI, 
–0.8 to 1.2), weakly favoring SSRI. Skarphedinsson et al. and 
POTS presented remission rates of ln OR = –0.2 (95% CI, –1.5 
to 1.0; and –0.9 (95% CI, −2.0 to 0.3); respectively, as defined 
by end-treatment CY-BOCS ≤11 (4, 18). The combined ln OR 
was −0.6 (95% CI, −1.4 to 0.3), which weakly favors CBT. Both 
comparisons were statistically non-significant (P > 0.05).
Combined Therapy With SSRI and CBT 
Versus Placebo
From studies included in our review, only one study (4) undertook 
a comparison of combination treatment versus placebo. The SD 
values of change from baseline could not be extracted from the 
paper or retrieved otherwise. Thus, only the end-treatment mean 
CY-BOCS could be compared.
The combination treatment and placebo arms yielded scores 
of 11.2 (SD = 8.6) and 21.5 (SD = 5.4), respectively, and the mean 
difference (MD) of these scores demonstrated the combination 
to be significantly superior (MD = −10.3, 95% CI, −14.1 to −6.5) 
compared with placebo (SMD = −1.41, 95% CI, −2.0 to −0.82). 
The paper also provided data regarding remission rates as defined 
by achieved CY-BOCS ≤11 with odds ratio of 31.1 (ln OR = 3.4; 
95% CI, 1.3–5.6) and 50% risk difference, which were statistically 
significant (P < 0.05).
Combined Therapy With SSRI and CBT 
Versus CBT Alone
Only two studies (4, 24) presented outcomes for comparing SSRI 
and CBT combination and CBT monotherapy. Both studies used 
sertraline as the intervention medication and reported outcomes as 
end-treatment CY-BOCS scores. In the study by Storch et al., CBT 
was combined with placebo, and not used as actual monotherapy 
(24). The study involved two arms: one with regular dosing and the 
other with titrated dosing. The titration arm was used to compare 
to the POTS study, which only used the dose titration approach.
In the study by Storch et al., a mean difference of −0.2 
(95%  C,: −6.2 to 5.8) was observed between the regular and 
CBT + placebo arms with an effect size of −0.02, 95% CI: −0.74, 
0.69 (24). The titration arm showed MD = 1.6; (95% CI, −3.3 
to 6.5; SMD, −0.2; 95% CI, −0.5 to 0.9). Both findings were 
non-significant. The POTS study achieved a mean difference of 
−2.8 (95% CI, −7.6 to 2.0), which was of small effect size, albeit 
insignificant (SMD = −0.3, 95% CI, −0.83 to 0.22) (4). A pooled 
analysis of the data from POTS and titration arm of Storch et 
al., utilizing the random effects model (as the Storch et al. study 
did not actually use CBT monotherapy but CBT + placebo) 
achieved a mean difference of −0.6 (95% CI, −4.9, 3.7) and effect 
size of −0.1 (95% CI, −0.6, 0.4, thus demonstrating no significant 
difference (4, 24).
Combined Therapy With SSRI and CBT 
Versus SSRI Alone
Two studies (4, 26) compared the combination of SSRI and 
CBT with SSRI monotherapy. Both reported end-treatment 
CY-BOCS data. The study by Neziroglu et al. specifically 
compared the combination treatment with monotherapy in a 
population that has previously failed CBT monotherapy (26). 
The authors evaluated the benefit of adding CBT on SSRI 
treatment regimen. Raw data were available and included the 
end-treatment CY-BOCS for baseline, 10, 43, and 52 weeks, 
and at 2 years follow-up, and change scores. To encompass 
homogenous treatment durations the comparison was made 
using data from the 52nd week. A mean difference of −5.4 
(95% CI, −11.3, 0.5 was observed with a significant, large effect 
size of SMD, −1.0, (95% CI: −2.4 to 0.4). The POTS study 
yielded a mean difference of −5.3, 95% CI: −10.0, −0.7 with 
a moderate effect size of −0.6, 95% CI: −1.1, −0.1, which was 
significant (4). The pooled analysis of data from both studies 
comprising a total of 66 patients achieved a mean difference 
of −5.3 (95% CI, −9.0 to −1.7), which was significant and of 
moderate effect size (SMD = −0.7, 95% CI: −1.1, −0.2), thus 
favoring the combination treatment.
Comparison of SSRI Versus No SSRI 
Intervention Arms
Considering placebo to be not an “actual intervention,” it was 
suggested that a comparison could be made between treatment 
arms that did or did not use SSRI. Four studies suitable for 
such analysis were reported [Refs. (4, 18, 24, 27)]. All four used 
sertraline as the SSRI of intervention. Three compared SSRI and 
CBT monotherapies, and two compared the combination of 
SSRI and CBT with CBT monotherapy (see Table 7). A pooled 
analysis of the mean differences using generic inverse variance 
and random effects analysis model demonstrated no significant 
difference between the two interventions (MD = 0.26, 95% CI, −1.7 
to 2.2) (see Figure 4).
Comparison of SSRI Versus All No SSRI 
Interventions, Including Placebo
Contrary to the comparison above, another suggestion was 
made to make a comparison in a similar fashion but including

placebo as an “intervention” (see later in the discussions). 
Data  from  SSRI  vs. Placebo comparison were added to the 
previous generic inverse variance analysis. The SSRI + CBT vs. 
Placebo arm of POTS study was not included in the analysis, as 
having a large effect size (SMD = −1.4, 95% CI: −2.0, −0.8) would 
clearly deviate the results. The pooled analysis demonstrated a 
mean difference of −2.3, 95% CI, −3.6 to −1.1, which was of small 
size, albeit significant (see Figure 5).
Comparison of Different SSRIs
None of the identified studies utilized head-to-head design to 
directly compare outcomes of different SSRI treatments. Data 
of end-treatment CY-BOCS scores from all available studies 
reporting a treatment arm of SSRI monotherapy were compared 
using generic inverse variance and random analysis model (see 
Figure 6). Four studies were using sertraline (4, 18, 27, 32), 
four studies using fluoxetine (25, 28–30), two studies using 
fluvoxamine (26, 33), one study using paroxetine (31), and one 
study using citalopram (28). The standard deviations or errors 
were reported in all articles except in Alaghband et al., for 
which the reported p values (<0.001 for both arms) were used to 
ascertain the possible t values from the t tables and to calculate 
the standard errors with Rev Man calculator (28). The estimated 
t and p values for fluoxetine and citalopram were t = 4.54, p = 
0.0005 and t = 4.57, p = 0.0005, respectively. These converted to 
standard errors of SE = 3.3 and SE = 3.7, respectively.
The pooled results of studies that used the same SSRI were 
compared visually, and any gross differences (exceeding 2 
points on CY-BOCS) were evaluated via the I2 statistic (which 
is incorporated in Rev Man). This was facilitated by unchecking 
all the other subgroups not to be compared. The two largest 
subgroups, namely, the sertraline and fluoxetine, encompassing 
four studies each, appeared to achieve similar results (endtreatment mean CY-BOCS = 14.8 (95% CI, 12.5–17.1; and 14.7, 
95% CI: 13.0, 16.4; respectively). The largest grossly visualized 
difference was detected between subgroups of fluoxetine and 
fluvoxamine (14.7, 95% CI: 13.0, 16.4; 18.5; 95% CI, 16.6 to 
20.4; respectively), mandating an evaluation of heterogeneity 
between them. Once the other subgroups were unchecked 
from Rev Man, the test for subgroup differences displayed as:

notifies of considerable heterogeneity, suggesting a possibility

DISCUSSIONS
Summary of Main Results SSRI Versus 
Placebo
SSRIs are clearly effective compared to placebo for treating OCD 
in adolescents and children, but the effect size is small (SMD = 
−0.43), which converts to 3.5-point reduction in the CY-BOCS 
score. The clinical implication of this finding is hard to evaluate, 
as even though the change is statistically significant, some 3.5 
points reduced from the initial CY-BOCS of 25 is merely little 
symptom reduction to a score of 21.5, which by no means can 
be designated as response (in this scenario such reduction 
constitutes 14% and grossly differs from those defined in the 
literature, e.g. 25%, 30%, 40% reduction or CY-BOCS ≤16). Since 
the RCTs were conducted in a mean time period of 8 weeks, the 
observed effect represents only the short-term finding. Further 
studies with longer trial durations are required to assess the longterm effects and benefits of SSRI monotherapy.
Using the method put forward by Chinn (37), the pooled 
response rate transforms to SMD of 0.5, which in contrary to that 
seen in continuous outcomes, is already of moderate effect size. 
Summarizing the findings of dichotomous outcome comparison, 
it suffices to note, that the implicated definitions of 25%, 30%, 
or 40% reductions do not necessarily mean clinically significant 
symptom reduction but represent more conservative cutoffs to 
define minimal observable change (37). By far, the achieved 20% 
absolute risk reduction (RD) converts to a number needed to treat 
(NOT) of five patients, which could be interpreted as follows: one 
would need to treat five patients to achieve minimal clinically 
noticeable change in a single patient. Similar to response rates are 
those regarding remission, as defined CY-BOCS ≤11. Although 
reported in only one study, the absolute risk difference of 
FIGURE 5 | Comparison of interventions with SSRI versus all interventions without SSRI, A generic inverse variance analysis.

remission was 18%, which converts to NNT = 6 patients, which 
is somewhat consistent with that of response, adding a valuable 
notice, which for each six treated patients, one will respond 
and another one will probably experience remission. The lack 
of studies evaluating remission rates in SSRI vs. Placebo design 
limits the value of the later statement. The observed effect size for 
children and adolescents is somewhat similar to those reported 
in treatment trials of adults with OCD (38).
The reported findings across studies are overall reliable, as 
judged from risk of bias, albeit heterogeneous. The interpretations 
regarding the effectiveness of SSRI versus Placebo presented above 
are mainly consistent with those previously stated (21, 22, 39).
Future studies with the mentioned design are less probable, the 
reason being twofold. First, being superior over placebo does not 
yet advocate for the intervention’s clinical implications, especially 
when an even more effective treatment option clearly exists. Such 
an option, exemplified herein by CBT, has been fairly validated, 
and its efficacy in children and adolescents has been confirmed 
multiple times by various studies (11, 20, 21, 40–42). Second, 
leaving the “placebo” arms of children untreated for the study 
duration would be somewhat unethical. It is generally considered, 
that a comparison of this or that intervention with the current 
“gold standard” treatment would be far more appropriate in such 
settings. This has been clearly stated in the clinical epidemiology 
textbook by Haynes (43). It is expected that further research 
examining the efficacy of SSRIs in OCD treatment would more 
commonly use SSRI vs. CBT design, or evaluate the added benefit 
of SSRIs (e.g., SSRI + CBT vs. CBT), as discussed below.
The Effectiveness of SSRI in Other 
Comparisons
The only study comparing the combination of SSRI and CBT 
with placebo (4) found the former to be highly effective, with 
a mean CY-BOCS reduction of 10, which in clinical practice 
obviously would make a difference: bringing the CY-BOCS of 
a patient from 25 to 15 would denote both clinically important 
symptom reduction and match the definition of “response,” 
albeit not that of “remission” (4). Also, a 50% risk reduction 
was observed for remission, which transforms into NNT =  2. 
Despite  these  findings, only the end-treatment scores were 
compared instead of change scores. Thus, the validity of the finding 
FIGURE 6 | Comparison of SSRI end-treatment CY-BOCS scores. A generic inverse variance analysis.

cannot be ascertained. Besides, clinicians do not usually prescribe 
placebos to proudly state that the combination is superior to it, 
neither is the comparison of any value, as both CBT and SSRI are 
interventions and both could have contributed to the change, and 
the study cannot distinguish the input effect of each. As stated 
above, few studies of such designs are expected in the future.
There were two studies comparing the combination to SSRI 
monotherapy (4, 26) and two studies comparing it to CBT 
monotherapy (4, 24). A significant benefit was observed when 
adding CBT to SSRI treatment (with a mean five-point difference 
in CY-BOCS), but no significant difference after adding SSRI to 
CBT treatment. Both findings point to the superiority of CBT 
monotherapy and question the value of adding SSRI to the 
already effective treatment regimen with no additional benefit. In 
contrast to these findings, the pooled analysis of the three trials 
with a head-to-head comparison of SSRI and CBT (4, 18, 27) did 
not find any significant difference between the treatment options, 
albeit two studies weakly favored CBT, and one weakly favored 
SSRI. All three demonstrated small effect sizes. These findings 
raise the possibility that SSRI and CBT could be equally effective 
options, to begin with, but if the initial treatment is chosen to 
be CBT, adding an SSRI regimen would not have additive effect, 
although if the SSRI was the option to begin with, adding CBT 
sessions would be beneficial to the already “responsive” patient.
The limitation regarding trial duration is as well relevant here, 
and the question “which treatment option would hold the benefit 
for the longest period” is of important clinical implication.
The findings summarized above are mainly consistent with 
observations from adult studies (23). We conclude that SSRI 
and CBT could be equal options regarding initial effectiveness, 
which somewhat differs from the previous meta-analysis (39), 
although we appreciate the large effect sizes that CBT contributes 
to outcomes in various study designs.
Overall Effectiveness of SSRIs
To evaluate the overall effect of SSRIs across various treatment 
regimens, the effect sizes of all comparisons made between arms 
that involved an SSRI and those without an SSRI were entered 
into a generic inverse variance analysis. At first, placebos were not 
considered, and the overall benefit of SSRIs across four studies [6 
comparisons, 2 intervention arms in each of Storch et al. (24); and 
POTS (4)] did not reach significance, but after adding the studies 
comparing SSRI to placebo, a small, albeit significant difference 
was noted (4, 24). The interpretation of such findings is difficult. 
The authors concluded that the overall effectiveness is small and 
is mostly seen in studies comparing to placebo. The findings are 
consistent with the common clinical scenario, where prescribing 
an SSRI to a child with OCD, who is already receiving CBT, does 
not improve symptoms significantly over the course of 8 weeks 
and continued CBT.
Differences in SSRI Effectiveness
It suffices to say that the method implemented here was bizarre 
and nowhere near a head-to-head comparison or a network metaanalysis, but it was worth entertaining the idea that one SSRI 
could be superior over another (e.g., fluoxetine vs. fluvoxamine), 
thus setting soil for future investigations and direct comparisons. 
Overall the findings suggested the similar efficacy of fluoxetine 
and sertraline and favored these two over fluvoxamine, based on 
considerable effect size heterogeneity. As already mentioned, this 
does not replace direct comparisons, which are expected to take 
place in the future in part by RCTs probably receiving funding by 
pharmaceutical companies.
LIMITATIONS
The most important limitation is the paucity of studies 
incorporated into meta-analyses, which clearly prevents the 
use of more sophisticated research tools and publication bias 
reporting with funnel plots and trims and fill technique. The 
limitation of excluding non-English studies is also recognized.
CONCLUSIONS
The authors conclude that the results of current systematic 
review and meta-analysis support the existing NICE guidelines 
for choosing CBT as the first line of treatment or substituting 
it with an SSRI for patient preference matters, as both options 
seem to be equally effective and the choice rather depends on 
patient compliance with either option. Adding CBT to current 
SSRI treatment is an effective option for non-responders and 
partial responders but adding SSRI to ongoing CBT does not 
hold a significant benefit. The SSRIs have different effectiveness, 
and their relative efficacy remains to be investigated.
FUTURE RESEARCH
Head-to-head studies are required to evaluate the relative efficacy 
of different SSRIs, and a number of new direct studies are needed 
to compare SSRIs and CBT. Considering the interesting outcomes 
of group CBT, further studies should evaluate this intervention. 
The reported outcomes are expected to include pre- and posttreatment CY-BOCS scores, change from baseline and respective 
standard deviations, response and remission rates, with more 
homogenous definitions. A research guide from authorities for 
investigating treatment in children and adolescents with OCD 
would be appropriate and of great help to settle such reporting 
discrepancies. Regulations regarding study duration would also 
contribute to the future research to evaluate the long-term effects 
of different treatment regimens, which by all means remains 
uninvestigated in children and adolescents with OCD.
