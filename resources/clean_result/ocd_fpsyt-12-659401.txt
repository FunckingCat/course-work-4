Background: Few studies have investigated which patients with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) do not recover through regular cognitive behavior therapy or
pharmacotherapy and subsequently end up in intensive treatment like day treatment
or inpatient treatment. Knowing the predictors of intensive treatment in these patients
is signiﬁcant because it could prevent intensive treatment. This study has identiﬁed
predictors of intensive treatment in patients with OCD.
Methods:
Using 6-year longitudinal data of the Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder Association (NOCDA), potential predictors of intensive treatment were assessed
in patients with OCD (n = 419). Intensive treatment was assessed using the Treatment
Inventory Costs in Patients with Psychiatric Disorders (TIC-P). Examined potential
predictors were: sociodemographics, and clinical and psychosocial characteristics.
Logistic Generalized Estimating Equations was used to estimate to what extent the
various characteristics (at baseline, 2- and 4-year assessment) predicted intensive
treatment in the following 2 years, averaged over the three assessment periods.
Results:
Being single, more severe comorbid depression, use of psychotropic
medication, and a low quality of life predicted intensive treatment in the following 2 years.
Conclusions: Therapists should be aware that patients with OCD who are single, who
have more severe comorbid depression, who use psychotropic medication, and who
have a low quality of life or a drop in quality of life are at risk for intensive treatment.
Intensive treatment might be prevented by focusing regular treatment not only on OCD
symptoms but also on comorbid depression and on quality of life. Intensive treatment
might be improved by providing extra support in treatment or by adjusting treatment to
impairments due to comorbid depressive symptoms or a low quality of life.

Predictors Intensive Treatment OCD
INTRODUCTION
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing disorder,
often with a chronic course (1). There are evidence-based
treatments for OCD, namely cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)
and psychotropic medication, that can be oﬀered in more or less
intensive formats (2). Multidisciplinary guidelines recommend
determining the designated intensity of treatment according to
the principles of so-called “stepped care” (3–5). In line with
stepped care, the least intensive treatment possible is delivered
to patients ﬁrst, taking into account the nature and course of
their symptoms. In the case of non-response, treatment may be
“stepped up” to a more intensive level in an eﬀort to meet the
treatment goals (6). In the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guideline, the ﬁrst step in the treatment of
OCD consists of awareness, recognition and assessment (3). Next
step strategies comprise of CBT, antidepressant medication, or
a combination of these. In the case of non-response, treatment
is stepped up to treatment by a multidisciplinary team with
expertise in the management of OCD. Intensive treatment such
as day treatment or inpatient treatment may be considered in
this latter step for the most severe, impaired, and treatmentresistant patients. In the Netherlands, intensive treatment usually
consists of multimodal treatment, with CBT being the main
therapy, oﬀered in a group with other patients with anxiety
disorders and OCD. It can be oﬀered in a day-care setting or
in an inpatient setting. Intensive treatment usually takes several
(parts of) days a week up to 5 days a week for a few months
to 1 year. Admission may also be necessary when patients are
in crisis.
Up till now, no longitudinal studies into the predicting factors
of intensive treatment in OCD have been published. However,
cross-sectional research exists, describing the characteristics of
patients with OCD in intensive residential treatment. These
patients were treatment-resistant to antidepressants and/or
CBT, suﬀered from severe OCD symptoms and psychiatric
comorbidity (7–9), had an early age of onset of OCD and a long
duration of the disorder (10, 11), often did not have a partner or
a job (10–12) and had a low quality of life, with scores of one to
two standard deviations below the general population (13–17).
In populations with other mental disorders, more is known
about predictors of hospitalization. A systematic review of 58
papers on predictors of readmission in patients with several
mental disorders indicates that previous hospitalization, younger
age, being unmarried, having lower ﬁnancial means, not being
satisﬁed with the index treatment, having more hospital days on
the index admission, and a negative attitude toward medication
were predicting factors for psychiatric readmission (18). In
addition, being male, having psychotic symptoms, a longer
duration of untreated psychosis, less social satisfaction, disturbed
family dynamics, residing in an urban area, and illegal drugs
misuse were found predictive of hospitalization in recent
prospective cohort studies involving several mental disorders
(18–22). A population study combined several survey and
register databases of 2,638 individuals born in 1953, including
interviews with their mothers. From this study it appeared that
poor family relations in adolescence were associated with an
increased risk of inpatient psychiatric treatment in the years 1969
until 2008 (20).
Knowledge of characteristics that predict future intensive
treatment might help to optimize ﬁrst steps of treatment for
patients with OCD to prevent the need for intensive treatment.
This is signiﬁcant because intensive treatment may contribute
to stigmatization and the disruption of the lives of patients
by hindering work, education, care for children, hobbies or
social contacts (23, 24). In addition, intensive treatment is
expensive, which burdens society with costs. Nevertheless,
intensive treatment is still the best available treatment for
the most severe and impaired patients with OCD. Another
signiﬁcance of predictors of intensive treatment is that they might
be used to improve intensive treatment by tailoring it to the
characteristics of the patients who need it.
The goal of the present study was to identify predictors
of starting with intensive treatment. In the rest of the text,
we will refer to this as “predictors of intensive treatment,” for
reasons of readability. We have selected potential predictors
based on the above presented research ﬁndings in other
populations. In addition, potential predictors were selected
that have been associated with course and severity of OCD,
leading to the following potential predictors: sociodemographic
variables, clinical variables, and psychosocial variables including
personality traits (25, 26), the quality of the social network
(27), and childhood trauma (28–30). We hypothesized that
being male, being younger, having more severe symptoms, poor
insight in OCD, childhood trauma and a lower quality of social
relationships are predictors of intensive treatment.
METHODS
The
reporting
of
this
study
conforms
to
the
STROBE
statement (www.strobe-statement.org).
Procedure
Data were derived from the Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder Association (NOCDA) study, longitudinal cohort study
investigating the naturalistic long-term course of OCD in
patients referred to mental health care centers. The NOCDA
study design and baseline characteristics of the study sample
are described in detail elsewhere (31). The NOCDA study
was accredited by the Medical Ethical Committee of the VUUniversity Medical Center in 2005.
After their clinical assessment at one of the contributing
mental health clinics, 687 patients aged 18 years and over with
a lifetime diagnosis of OCD, as determined by the administration
of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders
(SCID-I) (32), were asked to participate in the NOCDA study.
Since NOCDA aims to follow a large representative sample of
OCD subjects in diﬀerent stages of the disease and with diﬀerent
degrees of illness severity, the only exclusion criterion was an
inadequate understanding of the Dutch language for the purposes
of the completion of interviews and self-report questionnaires.
Comprehensive measurements were done at baseline and after 2,
4, and 6 years.

Predictors Intensive Treatment OCD
Of the 687 patients who were asked to participate in the
NOCDA study, 419 (60.9%) gave written informed consent and
were enrolled in the study. A comparison on basic demographic
characteristics between patients that did (n = 419) and did not (n
= 268) agree to participate yielded no signiﬁcant diﬀerences.
Baseline measurements took place between 2005 and 2009
and included validated semi-structured interviews and selfreport questionnaires to gather information on a broad range
of variables related to OCD, comorbidity, and psychosocial
consequences. The baseline assessment took about 5 h. All
included participants were contacted after 2, 4, and 6 years for
assessment, irrespective of their treatment status. The follow-up
assessments took about 3 h and in most cases (80%) they were
performed by the same research assistant. During the follow-up
period, participants received treatment as usual. Three hundred
and eleven patients participated in the 2-year assessment (total
dropout 26%), 295 patients in the 4-year assessment (total
dropout 30%), and 272 patients in the 6-year assessment (total
dropout 35%).
Primary Outcome Measure: TIC-P
Treatment intensity was derived from the Treatment Inventory
of Costs in Patients with mental disorders (TIC-P) (33). This
is a 15-item interview assessing health care consumption in the
previous 6 months (at baseline) or since the previous interview
(at 2-, 4-, and 6-year). Treatment was scored as “intensive” when
patients responded on the TIC-P interview (33) by stating that
they were receiving day-care treatment or inpatient treatment in
a psychiatric hospital or a specialized OCD clinic. In all other
cases, treatment was scored as “not intensive.”
Potential Predictors of Intensive Treatment
in Patients With OCD
We
studied
three
categories
of
potential
predictors:
sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics.
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Age (in years), gender, having a partner (yes, no), having children
(yes, no), independent living situation [yes (living alone, with
partner or children), no (living in a mental health institution or
with parents)], education (number of years), paid employment
(yes, no), and income (16 categories of increasing income).
Clinical Characteristics
Severity of OCD was assessed using the Yale Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale for Severity (Y-BOCS) (34, 35). Age of onset
of OCD was assessed using the SCID-I as the earliest age
at which patients fulﬁlled the criteria for OCD. In order to
assess the number of current comorbid mental disorders, the
ascertained diagnoses on the SCID-I were counted (anxiety, mood-, post-traumatic stress-, eating-, somatoform-, and
substance-related disorders, and psychotic disorders). Presence
and severity of comorbid anxiety symptoms were assessed
using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (36), while comorbid
depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI) (37–39). Psychotropic medication was assessed
using the TIC-P (33), measuring use of all types of psychotropic
medication in the previous 6 months (at baseline and follow-up).
Insight in OCD was measured using the Overvalued Ideas Scale
(OVIS) (40).
Psychosocial Characteristics
Childhood trauma was assessed using the Structured Trauma
Interview (STI) (41). Traumas on the STI are: (1) early separation
from parent; (2) and (3) parental dysfunction of mother or father
respectively; (4) witnessing of interparental violence; (5) physical
abuse; (6) sexual abuse. Ascertained childhood traumas were
summed. Personality characteristics according to the Big Five
were assessed using the Five-Factor Personality Inventory (FFPI)
(42). Subscales of the FFPI are: extraversion, agreeableness,
conscientiousness, emotional stability, and autonomy. Social
support was assessed using the Social Support Inventory (43).
The self-rated EuroQol ﬁve dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D)
was used to assess quality of life (44). The EQ-5D contains ﬁve
dimensions signiﬁcant for quality of life: mobility, selfcare, daily
activities, pain/discomfort, and depression/anxiety.
Stable characteristics like age, gender, age of onset OCD,
childhood trauma, and personality characteristics were assessed
at baseline only. Characteristics that could vary over time
were assessed at baseline, 2- and 4-year assessment. These
characteristics were: relationship status, children, living situation,
education, employment, severity of OCD, number of current
comorbid mental disorders, comorbid anxiety and depressive
symptoms, use of psychotropic medication, social support, and
quality of life. An exception is the characteristic insight in OCD,
which was assessed at 2- and 4-year assessment.
Quality Aspects of NOCDA
The NOCDA study was coordinated by the Department of
Psychiatry at the Amsterdam UMC/GGZ inGeest, Amsterdam,
and included seven sites that were specialized OCD mental
health clinics spread over the Netherlands. All research assistants
had extensive experience in assessing OCD. In addition, they
received a 2-day course, and regular follow-up 1-day training
sessions in which videos of the SCID were rated, assessor rating
scales were practiced, and questions and problems raised by
the research assistants were able to be addressed. The ﬁrst
two interviews of all research assistants were audiotaped and
monitored by the ﬁeldwork coordinator in order to address any
misunderstandings or errors in performing the measurements.
All subsequent interviews were audiotaped for future reference.
The audiotapes were continuously randomly monitored in
about 10% of all taped interviews, as well as on the basis of
questions raised by the research assistants and the ﬁeldwork
coordinator. Assessments were done by around 30 research
assistants (profession: psychologist or experienced research
nursing staﬀ).
Statistical Analyses
Logistic Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with an
exchangeable correlation structure was used to estimate to
what extent the various characteristics (at baseline, 2- and 4year assessment) predicted intensive treatment in the following

period of 2 years, averaged over the three assessment periods
(see Figure 1).
The following GEE analyses were performed: (1) univariable
analyses in which all potential predictors were analyzed
separately;
(2)
multivariable
analyses
within
the
three
categories of potential predictors in which all variables of a
category showing statistical signiﬁcance in the univariable
analyses were analyzed together; and (3) a multivariable
analysis over the three categories including all variables
showing statistical signiﬁcance (p < 0.05) in the multivariable
analyses within the three categories of potential predictors.
A backward selection strategy was used to obtain the ﬁnal
multivariable models.
As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analyses but corrected
for Y-BOCS severity. Insight in OCD will be analyzed separately
using the other characteristics because it was assessed at 2- and
4-year assessment only.
RESULTS
Description of Potential Predictors of
Intensive Treatment
Table 1 presents the description of the potential predictors at
baseline, 2- and 4-year measurement that may predict whether
patients will receive intensive treatment in the following 2
years. The mean severity of OCD and comorbid symptoms
decreased from baseline to 2-year measurement. From 2- to 4year measurement, these severity scores stabilized or increased
slightly.
Description of 6-Year Course of Intensive
Treatment
Table 2 presents the description of the intensive treatment
variable over the course of 6 years. Over time, fewer patients were
treated in mental health care (outpatient care as well as intensive
treatment).
GEE Regression Analyses: Potential
Predictors of Intensive Treatment
Table 3 presents the results of the analyses of the potential
predictors of intensive treatment 2 years later over a time period
of 6 years.
In the univariable analyses, not having a partner, a dependent
living situation, fewer years of education, not having a paid
job, more severe OCD, more current comorbid diagnoses, more
severe comorbid anxiety and depression, use of psychotropic
medication, less extraversion, less autonomy, less social support,
and a lower quality of life all signiﬁcantly predicted intensive
treatment 2 years later.
In the multivariable analysis of the sociodemographic
variables, not having a partner and not having a paid job
signiﬁcantly
predicted
intensive
treatment
2
years
later.
Predictors
in
the
multivariable
analysis
of
the
clinical
variables were more severe comorbid depression and use of
psychotropic medication, while in the multivariable analysis
of the psychosocial variables a lower quality of life predicted
intensive treatment 2 years later.
For the ﬁnal multivariable model, in which all signiﬁcant
predictors
from
the
previous
multivariable
models
were
analyzed
together,
severity
of
comorbid
depression
and
quality of life could not be included together due to high
collinearity. Because severity of comorbid depression had
a
stronger
association
with
intensive
treatment,
a
ﬁnal
multivariable model was made with this variable and quality
of life was not included (Table 3 model 1). In this model,
not having a partner, more severe comorbid depression
and use of psychotropic medication signiﬁcantly predicted
intensive treatment 2 years later. When quality of life was
substituted for severity of comorbid depression in the ﬁnal
multivariable model (Table 3 model 2), it appeared that a
lower quality of life signiﬁcantly predicted intensive treatment
2 years later as well as not having a partner and use of
psychotropic medication.

From the sensitivity analysis, in which we repeated the
analyses but corrected for Y-BOCS severity, it appeared that the
same predictors were signiﬁcantly related to intensive treatment
in the ﬁnal multivariable analysis. Thus, these factors predict
intensive treatment independently of OCD severity.
Insight in OCD was not signiﬁcantly related to intensive
treatment [OR = 1.07, 95% CI (0.98, 1.18); p = 0.14].
DISCUSSION
We studied potential predictors of intensive treatment in the
subsequent 2 years in patients with OCD over the course of
6 years. It appeared that patients with OCD who were single,
who had more severe comorbid depressive symptoms, who used
psychotropic medication, and who had a low quality of life were
signiﬁcantly more likely to have intensive treatment 2 years later.
Our results on being single and more severe comorbid depression
resemble the results concerning other mental disorders (18,
19, 21). Thus, also in patients with OCD, these variables
predict future intensive treatment. Quality of life as a potential
predictor of intensive treatment has not been studied before.
Our result that psychotropic medication predicts future intensive
treatment is not congruent with previous research results in
which a negative attitude toward medication—and thus likely not

using medication—predicted admission (18, 22). This diﬀerence
might reﬂect the diﬀerent study populations. While in patients
with psychotic disorders or mood disorders medication has
a large eﬀect on symptoms and prevents relapse, crisis, and
hospitalization (45, 46), in OCD, medication has only a moderate
eﬀect. SSRIs cause a mean reduction of 3.2 points on the Y-BOCS,
over placebo, in patients with OCD according to a meta-analysis
including 17 studies (3,097 participants) (47). Therefore, patients
with OCD not taking medication usually does not lead to severe
relapse or crisis, or an increase in the risk of hospitalization. A
second explanation for our ﬁnding might be that stepped-care
principles were followed in the treatment of OCD that indicate
prescription of psychotropic medication before stepping up to
more intensive treatments (3).
Contradictory to our hypotheses, the following potential
predictors did not signiﬁcantly predict intensive treatment.
Remarkably, although severity of OCD was associated with
intensive treatment in the univariable analysis of our study, this
association disappeared in the multivariable models, indicating
that other variables were more important in predicting intensive
treatment. This might indicate that despair and limitations as
a result of OCD are more important reasons for intensive
treatment than severity of OCD per se. Next, insight in OCD
did not predict intensive treatment in our study. This is not
congruent with a previous ﬁnding in patients with several mental
disorders that better insight was predictive of readmission (48).
Also, it is not in line with previous ﬁndings that patients with
poor insight in OCD were less likely to seek mental health
care (49). In addition, poor insight in OCD was previously
related to severity and chronicity of OCD (50–52). Possibly,
eﬀects of insight and help-seeking on intensive treatment cancel
each other out. More speciﬁcally, patients with poor insight
are often severe and chronic patients for whom intensive
treatment is indicated. However, they are less likely to seek
help. Conversely, patients with good insight do seek help but
need intensive treatment less often. Lastly, childhood trauma
was not predictive of intensive treatment in our study. To our
knowledge, childhood trauma has not been studied as a potential
predictor for intensive treatment before. Contradictory results
have been found on the association between childhood trauma
and severity and chronicity of OCD (28–30, 53). While childhood
trauma is an important predictor of severity and chronicity of
depression in patients with depressive disorders, the relationship
between childhood trauma and severity and chronicity of OCD is
less clear (54).
The predictors of intensive treatment that have emerged
from our study might be used to tailor intensive treatment
to the characteristics of the patients involved. For instance,
single patients obviously lack the support from a partner,
which might make it harder for them to stay motivated in
the face of setbacks in treatment. Therapists may need to
organize or oﬀer extra support to pull these patients through.
Next, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms or with a
low quality of life may have diﬃculty following an intensive
treatment program. In that case, adapting the treatment to
the impairment of the patient may be helpful, and could be
done by including activation in treatment or by shortening
treatment days.
Our results indicate that intensive treatment might be
prevented by improving comorbid depression and quality of
life in ﬁrst-step treatments in addition to treating OCD. In
other words, to not focus only on diminishing OCD symptoms
in treatment but also on vitality and promoting a fulﬁlling
life with elements that patients want from life, like work,
pleasurable activities, a partner, and a social network. We
recommend therapists to encourage patients to fulﬁll life’s
wishes while allowing them to be hindered by OCD as
little as possible. In our clinical experience, patients tend to
postpone fulﬁlling their life’s wishes based on the idea that it
is better to wait until the OCD symptoms have disappeared.
However, this conviction contributes to the notion of being
disabled, which drives patients further away from their goals
in life and in treatment. Therefore, therapists should educate
patients about the importance of working on their life’s goals
in treatment in addition to working on OCD. Furthermore,
therapists can help to ﬁnd practical solutions to obstacles that
may arise.
During the last decade, it has been accepted that recovery from
mental disorders does not just entail having fewer symptoms
but also regaining functioning and resuming a meaningful life
(55). Guidelines like the NICE and the APA guidelines recognize
the importance of focusing on functioning and quality of life in
treatment (3, 4). Also, treatments are increasingly being evaluated
using quality of life outcome measures (56–58). Moreover,
recovery-oriented treatment programs have been implemented
for patients with severe mental illness like schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, major depressive disorder, borderline personality
disorder, and substance use disorders. These treatment programs
foster adapting to chronic mental illness and movement toward
personally meaningful goals like work and education (59–61).
Recovery-oriented treatment programs help to improve both

symptoms and functioning and help reduce hospitalization in
these patients with severe mental illness (59). Another treatment
that can be eﬀective in improving quality of life is acceptance
and commitment therapy (ACT), which aims to accept negative
feelings, while moving toward meaningful goals in accordance
with personal values (62–64).
A limitation of this study is that although we had a
longitudinal study design with potential predictors preceding the
outcome measure (intensive treatment) in time, we were unable
to establish causal connections between potential predictors
and intensive treatment. Future research should thus examine
whether treatment of the signiﬁcantly associated predictors
of our study indeed prevents intensive treatment. Another
limitation is the attrition rate of 35% over the course of 6
years. To investigate whether dropout was selective, we have
compared baseline characteristics of patients who participated
in the 6-year assessment with patients who did not participate.
Patients did not diﬀer on any of the baseline characteristics
except that patients who dropped out had less years of
education (mean = 11.7; SD = 3.3) compared to patients who
participated in the 6-year assessment [mean = 13.1; SD = 3.2;
t(416) = −4.2, p < 0.01]. In previous studies, education was
a determinant of attrition as well (65, 66). Presumably, our
results were not biased by selective attrition. Last limitation
is a potential historical eﬀect due to the fact that the data
was collected between 2005 and 2015. However, the intensive

treatments that were common in the Netherlands during the
NOCDA data collection have largely remained the same to
date. This study also had a strength: we had access to a
large, representative sample of treatment-seeking patients with
OCD who were followed for a long period of time. Thus, our
results are generalizable to clinically referred OCD patients in a
specialized setting.
In conclusion, therapists should be aware that patients
with OCD who are single, who have more severe comorbid
depression, who use psychotropic medication, and who have
a low quality of life or a drop in quality of life are at risk
for intensive treatment. This is signiﬁcant because knowledge
of these predictors might help to optimize ﬁrst-step treatments
for patients with OCD to prevent the necessity of intensive
treatment. In addition, the signiﬁcant predictors of our study
might be used to tailor intensive treatment to the characteristics
of patients involved. We advise working on comorbid depression
and personal goals in treatment in addition to working on
OCD. Also, we advise providing extra support in treatment for
patients who need it and to adjust treatment to impairments
due to comorbid depressive symptoms or a low quality
of life.

FUNDING
The research infrastructure needed to complete the baseline
measurements (including personnel and materials) has been
ﬁnanced almost exclusively by the participating organizations
(Academic Department of Psychiatry, UMC/GGZ inGeest,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Marina de Wolf Centre for Anxiety
Research, Ermelo; Centre for Anxiety Disorders Overwaal, Lent;
Dimence, GGZ Overijssel; Department of Psychiatry, Leiden
University Medical Centre, Leiden; Mental Health Care Centre
Noord- en Midden-Limburg, Venray; Academic Anxiety Centre,
PsyQ Maastricht, Maastricht University, Division Mental Health
and Neuroscience). The ﬁeldwork coordinator was ﬁnanced for 1
year by a research grant from the Stichting Steun.
