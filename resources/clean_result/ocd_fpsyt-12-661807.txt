Background: This was the ﬁrst randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to
compare the efﬁcacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on unmedicated
obsessive-compulsive disorder with that of the ﬁrst-line treatment for OCD (SSRIs) or a
placebo, as well as to analyze the treatment acceptability and safety of MBCT.
Methods: A total of 123 unmedicated OCD patients with mild to moderate symptoms
were randomly assigned into selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors group (SSRIs group),
MBCT group or psycho-education group (PE group), respectively. They were intervened
for 10 weeks. The Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) grade was
the primary outcome, and Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24) and Hamilton
Anxiety Scale (HAMA) grades were secondary outcomes to be measured at baseline,
mid-intervention, post-intervention and 14, 22, and 34 weeks of follow-up. The Five Facet
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) were used to
assess mindfulness and social functions, respectively. In addition, treatment acceptability
(dropout rate and frequency of occurrence) and safety [adverse event (AE)] of MBCT
were investigated.
Results: Signiﬁcant differences were detected in the treatment responses among SSRIs
group, MBCT group and PE group. Notably, treatment responses were signiﬁcantly better
in the former two groups than that of PE group (χ2 = 6.448, p = 0.04), although we did
not identify signiﬁcant differences between SSRIs group and MBCT group (χ2 = 1.220,
p = 0.543). Observed until 6 months of follow-up, there were no signiﬁcant differences
in treatment response among three groups. No AE was recorded in MBCT group.
Conclusion:
MBCT is effective in the treatment of unmedicated OCD with mild to
moderate symptoms comparable to that of SSRIs, which contributes to maintain the
treatment outcomes at follow-up. Besides, MBCT is safe with a good clinical compliance.

RCT of MBCT for OCD
INTRODUCTION
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition
characterized by repeated obsessions and compulsions (1), which
causes chronic damage to cognitions, social functions and quality
of life (2). In mainland China, the current and lifetime prevalence
of OCD from 2013 to 2015 were 1.60 and 2.40%, respectively (3).
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response/ritual
prevention (ERP) are now the ﬁrst-line treatments for OCD,
which have been developed for a long time. However, a part of
OCD patients develop resistance to them, and their limitations
also trigger us to develop more eﬀective treatments of OCD. It is
reported that 25% of OCD patients refuse to use CBT-ERP; 20%
drop out the treatment; and 15–40% are poorly responded (4–
6). In another clinical trial, 30–40% of OCD patients treated with
CBT, SSRIs or a combination develop residual symptoms (7).
Mindfulness treatment has emerged as a novel and promising
approach for the treatment of OCD. Mindfulness is a mental
state and process leading to a non-judgmental awareness of
present moment experience (8), and a severe deﬁciency of
mindfulness is considered to be a feature of OCD (e.g.,
attentional bias, rumination, thought–action fusion, inﬂated
responsibility, self-invalidation of sensory experience, selfdistrust) (9, 10). It is believed that mindfulness-based treatment
is beneﬁcial to the following aspects: (1) To integrate a less
frightening ERP intervention with an anti-ruminative and antiavoidant attitude (mindful exposure) that reduces the risk of
dropout; (2) To improve insight, reality testing and acceptance
attitude to experience the impermanence of thoughts, emotions
and sensations; (3) To develop metacognitive and defusion,
decentering and disidentiﬁcation processes; (4) To strengthen
the sense of responsibility, self-trust, self-compassion and selfforgiveness; (5) To weaken the obsessive cognitive biases,
dysfunctional beliefs and compulsive behavior of OCD. So the
MBCT for OCD program is trying to help patients to develop a
better relationship with their obsession and ﬁnd a new response
to the harmless context instead of the compulsion.
The standard CBT is aimed to change the cognitive content,
but the aim of mindfulness-based intervention is to change
the approach of relating to the cognitive content. Similar to
conventional interventions, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT) improves speciﬁc symptoms or intrusive thoughts
in OCD patients. Notably, MBCT highlights to develop a
diﬀerent mental style in OCD patients and changes the
relationship between OCD patients and their symptoms. Thus,
through neutralizing cognitive biases and mechanisms, altering
aﬀect regulation systems and dysfunctional responses, MBCT
contributes to change a series of symptoms stimulated by
harmless triggering stimuli in OCD patients.
The manualized treatment program used in this study (11)
basically satisﬁed to the structure of the original MBCT model
generated by Segal et al. (12), but it has been modiﬁed to
a 10-week treatment to address the unique clinical features
of OCD. Key features of this program includes normalizing
obsessive experience, developing trust and self-validation,
cognitive intervention and intensive training in mindfulness and
self-compassion. In a pilot study, Didonna et al. (10) showed a
signiﬁcant improvement in Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive
Scale (Y-BOCS) scores and other clinical measures, and a
correlated improvement in mindfulness skills in OCD patients
after MBCT intervention. As a well-recognized treatment, MBCT
is proved to be helpful in many mental disorders, such as major
depression disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, etc., and there
have been many meta-analysis studies reported the eﬀectiveness
of MBCT (13–18). Likewise, the rationale and utility of MBCT in
the treatment of OCD has been demonstrated.
Most of the existing research about MBCT intervention in
OCD patients is preliminary, with a small sample size (19, 20)
and qualitative data (21, 22), which suggested that MBCT can
potentially have a positive therapeutic eﬀect on predisposing,
activating and maintaining factors of OCD. And the only one
randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a large sample size (n =
125) investigated the eﬀectiveness of MBCT as a complementary
treatment option for OCD patients who are poorly responded
to CBT (23). In this research, participants were randomized
to either an MBCT group or to a PE group for eight 2-h
sessions interventions. The ﬁnding suggested that, compared
to a psychoeducational program, MBCT leads to accelerated
improvement of self-reported OC symptoms and secondary
outcomes, but not of clinician-rated OC symptoms. In fact, in
addition to being a synergistic intervention for patients with
residual symptoms, mindfulness-based treatments like MBCT
has been proven to eﬀectively alleviate acute anxiety and
depression (24). Leeuwerik et al. (25) investigated two qualitative
thematic analysis of interview data obtained from participants in
a mindfulness-based ERP course and a MBCT course adapted for
OCD without ERP tasks. Three common main themes emerge in
both MB-ERP and MBCT for OCD and some diﬀerent beneﬁts
are obtained from these two mindfulness-based interventions
(MBIs). So, we adapted most of the valid elements into the
MBCT, including the mindful exposure in the present study,
which is diﬀerent from previous programs.
Hence, unlike existing preliminary researches in which
MBCT is applied as a anti-depression program or a synergistic
intervention, this study was aimed to be the ﬁrst equivalent
clinical trial designed to test the eﬃcacy, treatment acceptability
and safety of MBCT on OCD patients, and compared with those
of the ﬁrst-line treatments SSRIs or a placebo for unmedicated
OCD with mild to moderate symptoms. We hypothesized that
the eﬃcacy of MBCT on alleviating obsession, compulsion,
anxiety and depression symptoms of OCD patients is equal to
SSRIs and better than PE, and the MBCT for OCD program
can improve mindfulness level and adherence to treatment of
OCD patients.
METHODS
Design
As shown in Figure 1, this was an single-blind, randomized,
actively controlled clinical trial with three study arms: SSRI
group; MBCT group; and PE group (26). Eligible unmedicated
OCD participants, including those without a medication history
of psychiatric drugs, or have been discontinued for more than 8

weeks were recruited from 7th June, 2017 to 30th July, 2018. They
were assigned to three groups using a pre-determined random
table generated by Microsoft Excel 2010. Only the case manager
had the information of the randomization. The numbers of
the participants were not decoded until the intervention group
was assigned. OCD patients were intervened for 10 weeks and
followed up. The ﬁrst participant ended the 6-month followup on 10th March, 2018, and the ﬁnal follow-up was on 8th
May, 2019. Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at
the following time points: Week 0 (baseline), week 4 (midtreatment), week 10 (post-treatment) and week 14, 22, and 34
(the follow-up phase). The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC),
and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov by the SMHC on 14th May
2017 (NCT03179839).
Participants
Participants were recruited from the outpatient department of
the SMHC. Informed consent was obtained prior to the clinical
trial, and participants of 3 groups were blind of the group,
but clear about the possible side eﬀect from psychotherapy
and medication. All participants were free to withdraw consent
and leave the trial at any time. Inclusion criteria: (1) Male or
female OCD patients aged 18–54 years who were diagnosed by
a Chinese version of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric
Interview [MINI] for DSM-5 with mild and moderate level of
OCD symptoms, which means Y-BOCS score ranging from 12 to
25 grades (27); (2) Junior/middle school education or above; (3)
Lack of a history of any psychiatric medication or, discontinued
for 8 weeks before the requirement; (4) Suﬃcient visual and
acoustic ability to complete the examination and questionnaires
for the study; (5) Informed consent was obtained from both
patients and their guardians. Exclusion criteria: (1) Other
psychiatric disorders diagnosed by DSM-5 Axis I diagnostic
criteria; (2) Severe physical or central nervous system disease; (3)
High negative self-concept or high risk of suicide; (4) Substance
abuse problems, pregnant women or plan to be, and lactating
women; (5) Severe obsessive and compulsive symptoms; (6)
Involved in other concurrent psychological therapy; (7) History
of mindfulness-based interventions without signiﬁcant eﬀects.

analysis
(28). According to the theoretical considerations, results of
comparable studies (29) and pilot data, it is assumed that the
priori test power 1 −β = 0.8, while the eﬀect size of d is 0.8.
A minimum sample size of n1 = n2 = n3 = 26 is suﬃcient to
detect this eﬀect through a t-test at the signiﬁcance level of p <
0.05 for a group × time interaction. Considering the dropout
rate, a total of 123 eligible OCD patients were ﬁnally recruited
from June 2017 to August 2018 in the outpatient department of
SMHC. Before interventions, 11 participants in MBCT group
and six in PE group were dropped out because of the waiting
period for collection and involvement in other treatments for
security guarantee. Hence, there were 41, 31, and 34 participants
in SSRI group, MBCT group and PE group, respectively. At

the post-treatment assessment, 19/106 (17.92%) cases dropped
out, involving 11, 3, and 5 in SSRI, MBCT and PE groups,
respectively (percentage of attendance < 0.6 was deﬁned as
dropout). The follow-up rate for 1, 3, and 6 months were 74.53,
67.92, and 66.98%, respectively. Inclusion and exclusion details
were shown in Figure 2. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in demographic characteristics and baseline data between OCD
patients who completed the treatment and dropout cases.
Interventions
Interventions in the three groups were conducted in the
outpatient department of SMHC. Both MBCT and PE program
consist of 11 sessions with 150 min each for 10 weeks, and each
group included 6–8 OCD patients with two therapists.

patients
was
conducted
according to the manual (10) drawn from the MBCT for
depression program (12), but adapted to OCD with diﬀerent
rationale and several unique practices speciﬁcally tailored to
OCD features (10, 30). Brieﬂy, MBCT for OCD includes a total
of 11 sessions: Session 1 is aimed at describing the concept
of mindfulness and recognizing the tendency of our minds to
wander. Session 2 is focused on understanding the relationship
between OCD and mindfulness. Session 3 is aimed at teaching
family members how to help and support patients eﬀectively.
Session 4 is about understanding mistrust and its role in OCD
so that patients can develop self-trust. In Session 5, patients
are trained in validating and using their senses to prevent
the distorted cognitive mechanisms that lead to obsessive
mechanisms. Session 6 is aimed at helping patients understand
their relationship with thoughts and develop the ability of
decentering and disidentiﬁcation. The focus of Session 7 is
on developing acceptance toward internal experience without

judgement, interpretations, and reactions. The theme of Session
8 is mindful exposure, and Session 9 is about self-compassion
and self-forgiveness. The focus of Session 10 is learning to
take constructive risks in a mindful way. Session 11 is a 1-day
mindfulness retreat, aimed at reviewing previous practices
and enhancing motivation to continuing the practices (26).
During each session, participants received handouts to facilitate
comprehension.
Participants
were
encouraged
to
practice
mindfulness exercises for at least 1 h a day at home after each
session with audio tracks.
The PE program, as an active placebo control condition,
consisted of propagating information about OCD, including
epidemiology,
biological
and
psychosocial
causes,
clinical
symptoms, family burden of OCD, and supportive sharing and
discussion (29, 31). The theme of Session 1 is the formation
of the group, including establishing rules and familiarizing the
members with each other. The theme of Sessions 2 and 3 is the
introduction to pathogenesis and inﬂuencing factors of OCD.
Session 4 is aimed to educate the family members of OCD
patients on how to help their families and themselves. Sessions
5 and 6 is about to provide information on the treatment of
OCD. The goals of Sessions 7 and 8 are for patients to share their
own experiences with OCD and to discuss their experience with
treatment. The theme of Sessions 9 and 10 is the prevention and
relapse of OCD. And Session 11 is to discuss plans for the future
and the support of each other (26).
This control group can choose to use SSRI drugs approved
by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the
treatment of OCD (Sertraline, Fluvoxamine, initial dose of
50 mg). Participants could adjust the dosage of SSRIs once a week
at most within the limit of the maximum dose in the instructions
of psychiatrists from this study. Benzodiazepine drugs could also
be medicated in OCD patients with sleep disorders, but may
not be continuously used for over 2 weeks. Other psychotropic
drugs were prohibited. The drugs in this study are commonly
used drugs with good safety proﬁles and common adverse
reactions including dry mouth, constipation, nausea, indigestion,
dizziness, fatigue, and sweating (32).
Treatment Fidelity
The instructors for MBCT were the same to those for PE:
Psychotherapists or psychiatrists specialized to OCD treatment;
Trained by the founder of MBCT for OCD (Fabrizio Didonna)
and one of the founders of MBCT (Mark Williams) to ensure
treatment ﬁdelity. Supervisions once a month during the
study were provided by Dr. Didonna to ensure the treatment
ﬁdelity as well. Psychiatrists who prescribed SSRIs attended
regular meetings to make sure that medication use consistently
ﬁtted the research requirements. We also have the quality
control supervisors to check the consistency and validity of the
research regularly.
Measurements
All assessments were carried out by qualiﬁed psychological
physicians who were trained before the program and had
evaluator consistency meetings once a month for quality control.
All of them were blind for the intervention group of participants
from the beginning to the last assessments.
Y-BOCS scores (33) were the primary outcome for evaluating
the eﬀectiveness. According to the international consensus
criterion (34), improvement of the Y-BOCS scores ≥35%
(reduction rate ≥35%) is deﬁned as a treatment response. Partial
response and non-response are deﬁned as a 25–35% reduction
rate and <25% reduction, respectively.
Hamilton Depression Scale-24 [HAMD-24: (35)] and the
Hamilton
Anxiety
Scale
scores
[HAMA:
(36)]
were
the
secondary outcomes, which reﬂected depression and anxiety.
Also, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ: (37,
38)] and the Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS: (39)] were used
to assess mindfulness level and social functions of OCD
patients, respectively.
Dropout rate and frequency of occurrence were recorded to
evaluate treatment acceptability, whereas adverse events (AEs)
were the treatment safety indicators.
Statistical Analyses
An overall analysis in all participants, involving those dropped
out in SSRIs group because of improved symptoms and those
absent in several sessions of MBCT and PE, may lead to
an underestimated eﬃcacy of SSRIs. Furthermore, we only
performed a per-protocol analysis in participants who completed
all sessions of interventions for assessing the eﬃcacy due
to the equivalence of SSRIs and MBCT in the treatment
of OCD.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and Chi-square
test were performed to compare continuous variables, and
categorical variables, respectively. Multiple imputations were
conducted to estimate the scores for non-follow-up participants
after post-treatment. The response to the Y-BOCS was analyzed
by the rank sum test, whereas the comparisons at diﬀerent time
points were conducted by ANOVA for repeated measurements
of baseline HAMA and HAMD scores as covariates. A two-sided
p value < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant, which was
also
available
for
the
secondary
analysis.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in gender of the total 87
participants, which including 60 male and 27 female (χ2 =
12.517, p < 0.001), and no diﬀerence in age (AVG = 28, t =
0.550, p = 0.584). As shown in Table 1, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in demographic characteristics or Y-BOCS scores were found
among three groups. However, baseline HAMD and HAMA
scores diﬀered among three groups even after randomization.
Bonferroni correction data showed that HAMA scores (p =
0.001) and HAMD scores (p = 0.004) were signiﬁcant lower in
PE group than those of SSRIs group. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences
were found in the other psychometric variables, including FFMQ
and SDS.

scores at baseline as covariates, Y-BOCS, Y-BOCS-O, Y-BOCS-C,
HAMD, HAMA, FFMQ, and SDS scores were found signiﬁcantly
elevated in all three groups (Table 3). In addition, there were
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in these scores at post-treatment and
6 months of follow-up. A signiﬁcant result in HAMD scores was
yielded from the interaction eﬀect of time point and intervention.

Treatment Acceptability
During the group treatment, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in the frequency of occurrence between MBCT (0.87 ± 0.218)
and PE group (0.74 ± 0.217) (F = 6.620, p = 0.012), indicating a
better compliance to MBCT than that of PE (Table 4).
In the 10-week treatment, 11/41 (26.83%) cases in SSRIs group
dropped out due to drug withdrawal, 3/31 (9.68%) in MBCT
group dropped out due to absent for more than four times
(one was too busy to attend, one left the city, and one for
personal reasons); and 5/34 (14.71%) in PE group dropped out
due to absent for more than four times (all for personal reasons).
There were 16 participants who did not complete the 6-month
follow-up, involving 6, 4 and 6 cases in SSRIs, MBCT PE group,
respectively. The majority was loss of follow-up, and only two
cases in PE reported AEs. The dropout rate was comparable at
post-treatment or follow-up without a signiﬁcant diﬀerence.
Treatment Safety
There were two PE participants who were modiﬁed to other
treatments, involving one received SSRIs and the other received
psychotherapy in the follow-up, because of their subjective will
for worsening symptoms and requested for another treatment.
Also, the assessment result of increased Y-BOCS scores was
managed as an AE. There was no AE reported in MBCT group.
No adverse reactions of SSRIs were recorded as well.

Investigations
FFMQ score of participants in SSRI and PE groups also increased.
We found a signiﬁcant correlation between the Y-BOCS scores
and FFMQ scores at both post-treatment and 6 months of
follow-up (Table 5).
Furthermore,
OCD
patients
in
MBCT
group
were
subclassiﬁed to four groups according to diﬀerent group
members and therapists for subgroup analysis. Y-BOCS response
did not signiﬁcantly correlated to the four subgroups, showing
that diﬀerent group members and therapists did not aﬀect the
validity of the MBCT in the treatment of OCD.
DISCUSSION
This was a prospective RCT involving three arms. Unmedicated
OCD patients with mild to moderate symptoms presented
a better response to Y-BOCS in MBCT and SSRIs groups
than those in PE group, although the signiﬁcant diﬀerence
disappeared at the 6-month follow-up. Furthermore, MBCT
presented a good treatment compliance in OCD patients over the
other treatments.
In the present study, the short-term eﬀectiveness of MBCT
on OCD was consistent with most previous ﬁndings (10, 40).
However, Külz et al. (23) found that there were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between MBCT group (n = 61) and PE group (n =
64) after 8 weeks intervention in Y-BOCS. The participants in this
study were OCD with residual symptoms after at least 20 sessions
CBT, so it indicated that the importance of cognition aspect in the
intervention. People who are not responded to CBT may also get
little improvement by MBCT, which emphasized that the MBCT
for OCD program cannot just adds mindfulness exercises into
CBT, it should be an integration with its own conceptualization.
Moreover, the same authors reported that the diﬀerence between
groups became signiﬁcant in the self-report instrument (OCI-R),
and they thought it suggested that MBCT may help OCD to be
more acceptable and validated which is more sensitive in OCI-R.
This is consistent with our hypothesis that mindfulness training
is able to develop and stabilize mental states that are incompatible
with the mental states stimulated in OCD patients has been
validated. We considered that the therapeutic eﬃcacy of MBCT
on OCD may result from neutralizing the cognitive biases and
mechanisms of OCD, to shift from the aﬀect regulation systems
and dysfunctional responses to acceptance and non-response.
For the long-term eﬃciency, our results showed that the
eﬃcacy of MBCT intervention on OCD patients maintained
until the 6-month follow-up, which was similar to that of SSRIs.
However, the dropout due to loss of contact and the frequency
and compliance of practicing mindfulness skills after MBCT,
which may inﬂuence the analysis and cause bias in the longterm result were important factors. We did not detect signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in treatment responses at follow-up period between
PE and the other two groups, which was consistent with previous
research (23). It may be attributed to a placebo eﬀect and group
supportive inﬂuence, especially the setting of 10 weeks of PE
group, aiming to be consistent with MBCT program. Secondly,
although randomization was conducted, baseline anxiety and
depression symptoms in PE group were milder than those in
other groups, and the conclusion still exited after covariate
analysis for balancing. Thirdly, dropout cases and two reporting
AEs in PE group may inﬂuence the results. Furthermore, MBCT
and PE were applied by the same treatment group, aiming to
avoid therapist bias, but this may also inﬂuence the results in PE
group regardless of the randomization and supervision.
Consistent with a previous study (24), MBCT interventions
signiﬁcantly improved depression, anxiety and quality of life,
which are predisposing, activating and maintaining factors
of OCD. There was a study compared MBCT with stress
management training (SMT) in treating OCD, which also showed
the advantages in relief to certain dysfunctional beliefs and stress
(41). Interestingly, the mindfulness level of OCD patients in the
three groups all increased at the same pace, although those in
SSRI and PE groups never received mindfulness therapy. Further
analysis indicated that the increased level of mindfulness was
correlated to reduced Y-BOCS scores, indicating that a high level
of mindfulness was beneﬁcial to alleviate OCD symptoms, and in
turn, remission of OCD symptoms increased mindfulness level.
Compared with the 20–25% dropout rate for CBT-ERP
(5) and 26.83% of that for SSRIs, MBCT showed a good
compliance, which supported the suggestion that mindfulnessbased treatment for OCD might reduce dropout rate or attrition
in psychological therapy (23, 42). It is considered that the high
dropout rate for ERP is related to the exposure leading to a high
level of anxiety, which cannot be well-tolerated by individuals
suﬀering from OCD. On the other hand, mindfulness practice
is an eﬀective form of exposure because it helps individuals
intentionally face their own thoughts, emotions and sensations
as they arise rather than reacting to them (9). Instead, they
learn to accept those thoughts, emotions, and sensations for the
harmless and impermanent mental events they are handling with.
Therefore, the combination of mindfulness-based treatment with
traditional psychotherapy may be eﬀective in changing the
symptoms and enhancing treatment compliance. Furthermore,
our results showed that MBCT treatment eﬃcacy was not
inﬂuenced by involved patients and therapists, and time points.
Thus, we considered that the 10-week MBCT in the treatment of
OCD is well acceptable and safe, which should be popularized in
clinical application.
Limitations
There were still some confounders in this study. The study
sample was not good enough, which included more men
than women overall and that baseline scores for anxiety and
depression in the PE group were still lower than those in the

RCT of MBCT for OCD
other two groups even after the randomization. Participants in
PE program also got 10 weeks intervention, which may result
in more improvement than normal 8 weeks psycho-education
intervention. These factors may contribute to the bias of the
results, heightened the improvement of PE. But still, the outcome
of PE was beyond our expectation because we considered that
PE was only an active placebo generally presenting a supportive
role. Also, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between intervention groups
(MBCT and SSRIs) and placebo group (PE) was only showed
in the comparison of clinical response, but not in the repeated
measures ANOVA of scores. So that, the speciﬁc function
of PE should be future investigated. Also, for the SSRIs
group, this study limited the dose and range of medication
administered, but did not record the process of medication
adjustment for each participant in detail, which may be relevant
to the eﬃcacy of the medication. In future studies, medication
administration in the SSRIs group needs to be included in a more
detailed analysis.
Another limitation in the present study is that we used the
active placebo as the comparison. In the future research, the
therapeutic eﬃcacy of MBCT on OCD should be compared
with other ﬁrst-line interventions like CBT. In addition, OCD
patients with severe symptoms or other psychiatric conditions
were excluded from this study, and these certain population
needs to be concerned. We conjecture that medication may
be more eﬀective for more severe OCD and that the gap
would be more signiﬁcant in the PE group, but given the
ethical issues, using CBT as a control group would be a more
appropriate choice.
And the long-term eﬀects of MBCT on OCD patients like
the subsequent practice require more research. Further study
should collect detail data about the frequency and duration of
mindfulness practices beyond the sessions. Meanwhile, group
support factors and practice conditions may also be beneﬁt to
the treatment of OCD, and in this study, the patients from SSRIs
cannot get the group support compared with those from MBCT
and PE, which may lead to a relatively less signiﬁcant eﬀect of
the medicine, so in-depth exploratory researches for the speciﬁc
eﬀectiveness factors of MBCT for OCD should be conducted in
the future.
Moreover,
the
DSM-5
removed
obsessive-compulsive
disorder from the category of anxiety disorders and deﬁned it
as a separate spectrum, and we also know that there are many
diﬀerent subtypes of OCD, but in this study we did not segment
the diﬀerent types of OCD for analysis. So whether the MBCT
for OCD program, or a mindfulness-based intervention, would
be eﬀective for other disorders with similar symptom problems
on the spectrum and whether it has diﬀerent eﬀects for diﬀerent
subtypes of OCD are worth further exploration in next studies
and can help us to clarify more about the mechanisms by which
the intervention works.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, MBCT could be considered as a novel intervention
of unmedicated OCD patients with mild to moderate symptoms.
In terms of the treatment response, the eﬃcacy of MBCT on
alleviating primary symptoms—obsession and compulsion, and
secondary symptoms—anxiety and depression of these OCD
patients is equal to SSRIs and better than PE. But the advantages
are not signiﬁcant in terms of the scale scores.
Also, the MBCT for OCD program can improve mindfulness
level and it is suitable to be applied in clinical practice, which
is acceptable and safe. In the future, we will continue to explore
novel psychotherapy approaches to the treatment of OCD.
