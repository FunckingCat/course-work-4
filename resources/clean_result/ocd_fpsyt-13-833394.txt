Background: Published evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is conﬂicting. Most studies suggest an increase
in the severity of OCD in people with pre-existing OCD, whereas some do not.
Aim: Given the conﬂicting evidence globally and lack of data from the Arab world, we
aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in
adults with pre-existing OCD.
Methods: A telephonic questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among adults with
pre-existing OCD and speciﬁcally with fear of contamination and washing compulsions
being major symptom dimensions of OCD. The severity of OCD during the pandemic was
compared with their pre-pandemic scores. The severity of OCD was assessed using the
Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS).
Results: Those with the duration of diagnosis of OCD of <10 years showed a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the mean YBOCS score of 5.54 from pre-pandemic to during
pandemic, which was signiﬁcant at p = 0.006. This signiﬁcance was maintained across
the Compulsive and Obsessive subsets of the scale.
Conclusion:
Adults with pre-existing OCD with fear of contamination reported a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms only if
the duration of their OCD diagnosis was relatively shorter (<10 years). In the context
of the conﬂicting evidence regarding the worsening of OCD symptoms due to the unique
infection control measures of this pandemic, this study highlights the importance of the
impact of the duration of the disorder and the subtype of the disorder. Such classiﬁcation
might help public health resources to be directed better at those most at risk and also
help us understand the very nature of this disorder better.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus Disease 2019 was declared as a public health
emergency by the WHO in March 2020 (1). This public
health emergency prompted large-scale lockdown to limit the
spread of infection and various public health measures were
implemented including frequent handwashing, use of face masks,
social distancing, and quarantining of infected individuals
(2, 3). Infectious epidemics are associated with an increased
level of anxiety and stress in the healthy population and
worsen symptoms among individuals with pre-existing mental
disorders (4, 5). The vulnerability of individuals with preexisting mental disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak has
been widely reported in scientiﬁc publications and ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder (OCD) is particularly relevant because of
the widespread fear of contamination and ritualized cleaning
behavior advocated to limit the spread of infection (6–8). Similar
ﬁndings have been reported from previous outbreaks such as
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and novel inﬂuenza
(H1N1), where obsessive-compulsive symptoms worsened due
to fears of acquiring infection (9, 10). In the current pandemic,
some commentators have considered patients with OCD to
be particularly vulnerable, especially patients with obsessions
around contamination (11). It was thus speculated at the start of
the pandemic that the OCD symptoms will increase during the
pandemic. However, the published evidence about the impact of
the pandemic on OCD so far is conﬂicting. Multiple studies in
nonclinical samples have reported an increase in OCD symptoms
(12–14). Most of the studies suggest an increase in OCD in people
with manifest OCD during the pandemic (15–19). Whereas some
do not (20).
In an online survey conducted in November 2020 in Germany,
it was found that the majority of participants with OCD were
negatively aﬀected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative
eﬀects were more pronounced in people with hand washing
compulsions. A total of 72% of the participants reported an
increase in OCD. This increase was signiﬁcantly stronger in
washers (15, 21). Ji G et al. conducted a prospective cohort
survey study in China (21). It examined if fear of negative events
aﬀects Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores
in the context of a COVID-19–fear-invoking environment. It was
concluded that the ﬁndings indicate that the fear of COVID-19
was associated with a greater Y-BOCS score, suggesting that an
environment (COVID-19 pandemic) × psychology (fear and/or
anxiety) interaction might be involved in OCD and that fear of
negative events might play a role in the etiology of OCD. Data
from Italy in July 2020 supports the notion of the exacerbation
of OCD symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as about
one-third of their sample reported clinical worsening of OCD
(16, 17).
Tanir et al. (18) looked at a sample of children and adolescents
with a primary diagnosis of OCD in a university hospital
(18). They report a signiﬁcant increase in the frequency of
contamination obsessions and cleaning/washing compulsions
during the pandemic period with a signiﬁcant relationship
with talking/searching in the social environment about COVID19, daily preoccupation about COVID-19, duration of OCD
diagnosis, and diagnosis of COVID-19 in someone familiar.
Nissen et al. (19) explored the immediate eﬀect of the COVID-19
pandemic on two groups of children and adolescents, one newly
diagnosed with OCD and the other, who was diagnosed years
ago and their primary treatment was completed. They report
worsening of symptoms in both groups but more pronounced in
the group who were diagnosed years ago (19).
Chakraborty and Karmakar 2020 did not ﬁnd any increase
in obsessive and compulsive symptoms in patients with an
obsession with contamination and compulsive washing before
the pandemic. This study conducted in India report a very
small proportion of patients (6%) experiencing symptoms of
exacerbation (20).
There are limited studies looking at the impact of the
pandemic on OCD in the Arab world. Khan et al. explored the
association of pandemic with obsessive-compulsive symptoms
in adolescents with preexisting mental and behavioral disorders
in Qatar and reports signiﬁcant pandemic fears associated with
obsessive-compulsive symptoms (22).
Given the conﬂicting evidence globally and limited data from
the Arab world, we aimed to explore the impact of pandemic fears
on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in adults with pre-existing
OCD in Qatar. Qatar is a peninsula in the Arabian Gulf, with
a population of ∼2.7 million, of which ∼75% are men, and
operates a publicly funded healthcare system (23).
METHODS
Design, Settings, and Participants
This was a cross-sectional, single-center, exploratory study
conducted within the adult mental health service, Hamad
Medical Corporation, Qatar. The patients with a pre-existing
primary diagnosis of OCD (with fear of contamination and
washing compulsions being major symptom dimensions of
OCD) were included in the study. The list of participants
was obtained through a system-generated search based on the
diagnostic code of OCD, which generated a sample of 300
patients registered with adult mental health services. In total, 36
patients out of 300 were identiﬁed to have fear of contamination
and washing compulsions as a major symptom dimension of their
OCD by reviewing their clinical information and thus deemed
eligible for the study. At the time of the data collection, in January
2021, the State of Qatar was under a strict lockdown at that time
with strict measures to contain the spread of infection. There
were restrictions of gatherings, schools were closed, and it was
encouraged to work from home.
Inclusion Criteria
All adult patients aged 18–65 with a pre-existing primary
diagnosis of OCD with fear of contamination and washing
compulsions being major symptom dimensions of OCD and
agreed to participate were eligible.
Exclusion Criteria
Inability to consent for participation in the study due to
underlying mental or physical health conditions or inability to
engage with the interview.

All eligible patients consented to participate, and all were
selected as the number was small. The study design was
exploratory, we did not set and formulate any prior statistical
hypothesis and, therefore, we did not perform any formal sample
size calculation.
Measures
The survey questionnaire included two sections. The ﬁrst section
was designed to collect data on demographic characteristics
(age, gender, and ethnicity) and information regarding the
duration of OCD, psychiatric co-morbidity, current medication,
and mitigating factors. The second section assessed the severity
of OCD symptoms using the Y-BOCS (24–27). The survey
questionnaires were in English and Arabic, and the validated
Arabic translation was used. The initial draft of the composite
data collection tool was piloted on ﬁve participants by two
researchers to assess the feasibility of the data collection tool.
Modiﬁcations were made to the data collection tool to account for

missing or unclear information and a ﬁnal version was approved
after discussion with the wider team. To achieve maximum
reliability among the raters, a training session about the rating
methods and terms was carried out.
The Y-BOCS is the gold standard to evaluate the severity of
OCD symptoms. It is the most widely used semi-structural scale
in both clinical and research settings. Y-BOCS is a validated and
established self-administered tool combining self-reported and
clinician-rated questions. The Y-BOCS is sensitive to change and
hence helps to determine improvements or exacerbation of the
disorder symptomatology. Studies of the Y-BOCS have shown
that it has adequate psychometric characteristics, including good
interrater reliability and predictive validity (28). It consists of a

comprehensive symptom checklist to identify the speciﬁc type
and content of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in addition
to a 10-item rating scale. The scale is divided into two subscales
that separately measure obsessions and compulsions. For each
subscale, ﬁve aspects of obsessive and compulsive pathology
are each rated on a scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 4
(extreme symptoms): time spent, degree of interference, distress,
resistance (greater resistance is assigned lower scores), and
perceived control over the symptom. Subscale scores are summed
to yield a Y-BOCS total score. A total score of 0–7 is considered
nonclinical. Scores ranging between 8 and 15 are considered
mild. Scores between 16 and 23 are considered moderate and
scores between 24–31 and 32–40 are considered severe and
extreme, respectively. These instruments were administered by
healthcare professionals, proﬁcient in both English and Arabic
languages comprising two psychiatry trainees. Both trainees were
proﬁcient in administering the tools. Interviews were carried out
in the month of January 2021, and the data was collected for
this study.
Ethical Considerations
The study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Research
Center (MRC-01-20-105) and the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) at Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar. Phone calls
were made to all participants included in the sample to invite
them to the study. Consent of the participating individuals
was obtained verbally over the phone and recorded. All
information relevant to the study including its purpose,
impact
on
clinical
care,
and
conﬁdentiality
safeguards
were provided.
The Strategy of Data Analysis
All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS R⃝Statistics version
26 (IBM, NY, USA).
Paired Sample t-test was used to compare the means
from
the
same
group
at
diﬀerent
times.
This
test
helped us to know how signiﬁcant the diﬀerences were
between the groups.
Pearson correlation test was used to determine the linear
correlation between the two sets of data (pre-pandemic
and pandemic).
Mann Whitney U test was used to compare diﬀerences
between two independent groups when the dependent variable
is either continuous or ordinal but not normally distributed.
Diﬀerences in Obsessions, compulsions, and total YBOCS
scores during pre-pandemic and pandemic times were measures.
RESULTS
Socio-Demographic Characteristics
Of these 36 patients, about 70% were females compared to
30% males which are in line with the global prevalence of
this illness. Qataris constituted 30% of the sample although
they represent only around 10% of the population (23). N
= 15 (41.7%) had a duration of the diagnosis of OCD for
over 10 years. N = 13 (36%) of the individuals had a comorbid psychiatric illness, of which the majority, N = 10
had depression. Majority, N = 30 were maintained on antdepressants and only N = 6 individuals were on anti-psychotics
(Table 1).
Differences Between the Scores of
Patients With OCD Before and During
COVID-19
The mean YBOCS before the pandemic was 15.6 (SD 9.4) and the
mean YBOCS during the pandemic was 18.08 (SD 10.6), with no
signiﬁcant statistical diﬀerence for the group as a whole (p = 0.11,
2-tailed paired t-test) (Table 2).
The mean YBOCS before the pandemic for the Obsessions
scale was 8.03 (SD 4.84) and the mean YBOCS during the
pandemic was 9.42 (SD 5.5), with no signiﬁcant statistical
diﬀerence for the group as a whole (p = 0.13, 2-tailed paired
t-test) (Table 2).
The mean YBOC before the pandemic for the Compulsions
scale was 7.61 (SD 5.9) and the mean YBOCS during the
pandemic was 8.67 (SD 5.6), with no signiﬁcant statistical
diﬀerence for the group as a whole (p = 0.20, 2-tailed paired
t-test) (Table 2).
There were no signiﬁcant correlations between changes in YBOCS scores and socio-demographic variables. Those with the
duration of diagnosis of OCD of <10 years, N = 21, showed a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in the mean YBOCS score of 5.54
from pre-pandemic to during pandemic, which was signiﬁcant at
p = 0.006, Tables 3, 4.
This
diﬀerence
was
maintained
even
for
individual
components of the Y-BOCS scale for this group. The Obsessions
and the Compulsions subscales of the Y-BOCS showed a
signiﬁcant change in scores of 0.02 and 0.004 respectively,
Tables 3, 4.

of

symptoms
in
patients
with

diagnoses
and speciﬁcally with fear of contamination in the state

The
main
ﬁnding
of
this

is
that
there
was
worsening
of
OCD symptoms for individuals with a relatively shorter
duration of existing OCD diagnosis (<10 years) during
the

pandemic
compared
to
pre-pandemic
symptom severity.
Published evidence so far has largely looked at the impact of
COVID-19 on OCD in general, rather than focusing speciﬁcally
on OCD with contamination fears or with the duration of
the OCD. We set out to study this subset of the aﬀected
population as the main strategy for the control of the pandemic
has been an emphasis on the prevention of the spread of
infection by avoiding close contact and ritualistic hand hygiene
measures (20). While a necessary measure, it has resulted in
an increase in fears of contamination in the general public
and vulnerable populations triggering obsessive-compulsive type
symptoms fuelled by fears of contamination (21, 22). Two
of the four main symptom domains of OCD are the fear of

contamination and washing rituals (29). Amongst the diverse
symptom dimensions of OCD, the most frequently recurring
themes are obsessions related to contamination (29). There is
a growing evidence base that emphasizes the importance of
symptom subtypes of OCD in relation to its course, treatment
response, and prognosis (30–32). This study was therefore
careful in selecting only those participants whose obsessions
and compulsions were directly linked to the infection control
measures of COVID-19.
We
hypothesize
that
those
with
a
long
duration
of
OCD
symptoms
were
not
signiﬁcantly
aﬀected
by
the
COVID-19 infection control measures due to the stability
of
their
symptoms
and
presumably
wider
exposure
to
varying situations. This has an important public health
implication of directing extra help and support for those
with shorter duration and newly diagnosed OCD. Identifying
people at risk of worsening OCD and other mental health
problems during this or any future pandemics is important
to help formulate informed utilization of limited public
health resources. This is in line with the World Health
Organization’s Policy Brief: COVID-19 and the Need for
Action on Mental Health and other global mental health
organizations (33).
It is important to note that our data was collected
in January 2021, and there is evidence the increase in
mental
distress
that
occurred
during
the
emergence
of
COVID-19
largely
diminished
in
the
months
to
follow
due
to
the
population-level
resilience
in
mental
health (34). It is possible that as the duration and the
nature of the pandemic evolves, these subset diﬀerences
might disappear.
Given the conﬂicting evidence arising from the reported
studies so far, this study, although exploratory, highlights
important
caveats
that
future
studies
should
keep
in
mind
before
carrying
out
population-based
studies
on
COVID-19
in
this
pandemic.
Future
studies
should
consider the subtypes of OCD and also the duration of
the diagnosis of OCD. Further, as this pandemic evolves,
prospective
longer-term
studies
will
help
us
understand
not just the impact of this pandemic on this disorder
but will possibly also shed some light on the nature of the
disorder itself.
Limitations
The study design was exploratory, we did not set and
formulate
any
prior
statistical
hypothesis
and
did
not
have
a
control
group.
There
is
a
range
of
potential
mechanisms by which COVID-19 could impact OCD and
cohort studies are necessary to determine the incidence,
etiology,
and
prognosis
of
COVID-19-associated
OCD.
