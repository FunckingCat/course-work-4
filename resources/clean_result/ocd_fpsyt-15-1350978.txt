were recruited and allocated to active or sham rTMS groups for two weeks. The
mean age of the participants was 31.61, with 17 males (47.22%) and 19 females
(52.78%). Peripheral blood samples (5 mL) were collected from each participant
using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacuum tubes for genotyping
purposes, clinical evaluation was taken place at baseline and second week.
Results: The A allele of RS4680, C allele of RS16965628, and GG allele of
RS1019385 were identiﬁed as potential bio-markers for predicting treatment
response to OCD treatments (rTMS & SSRIs).
Conclusion: Those genes may serve as bio-markers for the combined treatment
of rTMS and SSRIs in OCD. The ﬁnding hold promise for further research and the
potential implementation of precision treatment of OCD.

Introduction
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric
disorder, characterized by persistent distressing obsessions and/or
compulsions that impair the quality of daily life, associated with
severe functional impairment (1–3). Previous research studies have
indicated that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are effective
treatments for OCD (4–9).
The therapeutic efﬁcacy of SSRIs could be supported by the
serotonergic hypothesis (10).
The hypothesis postulates the presence of an aberration,
presumably a diminution of function, within the serotonergic
system in OCD, or posits the implication of the serotonergic
system in some capacity in the pathogenesis of OCD (11–13).
Thus, the SSRIs could be effective in treating OCD might because
they target on the serotonin system (6, 14). However, it could also
be argued that the development of the serotonin hypothesis
stemmed from the efﬁcacy of SSRIs in treating OCD, there are
still numerous other medicines and treatments that are beneﬁcial
for OCD patients. Nonetheless, SSRIs is still one of the effective
treatment for OCD (15–17).
RTMS is a comparatively new treatment approach for OCD,
which was designed for resistent OCD, and those who cannot afford
the huge side effects of medicines (4, 18, 19). As a non-invasive
neuromodulation technique, rTMS harnesses rapidly altering
electromagnetic ﬁelds produced by a coil positioned on the scalp to
modulate cortical and subcortical function (5, 20, 21). By adjusting
stimulation parameters, rTMS can selectively diminish or enhance
cortical excitability in speciﬁc regions; frequencies equal to or below
1 Hz typically inhibit activity (referred to as low-frequency rTMS),
while frequencies at or above 5 Hz typically stimulate activity
(referred to as high-frequency rTMS) (22–24). As several studies
suggested, low-frequency rTMS administered over the (pre-)
supplementary motor area (pre-SMA/SMA) has been observed to
reinstate cortical inhibition in the motor cortex among OCD patients,
correlating with amelioration in OCD symptoms (20, 25–27).
However, it has been observed that some patients exhibit
inadequate response to these therapies. For instance, studies have
shown that SSRIs are ineffective for 40-60% of OCD patients (18,
28). Similarly, some studies did not observe adequate therapeutic
effect of rTMS on OCD (29–31), and there is insufﬁcient evaluation
of the therapeutic efﬁcacy of rTMS treatment on OCD (20, 32). In
light of this, the concept of candidate genes that may impact the
therapeutic effect of OCD treatments has been proposed (33), they
identiﬁed the LL allele of 5-HTTLPR (L/S) in the candidate gene
SLC6A4 as a potential bio-marker for OCD treatment. Since there
may be other bio-markers, attention has been directed towards
genes within the neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonin
transporter gene SLC6A4, the glutamate receptor gene GRIN2B, and
the gene related to serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and
epinephrine (COMT) which have been previously identiﬁed as
candidate genes for OCD (34–38).
As a gene that has already been identiﬁed as a potential candidate
for OCD treatment, SLC6A4 holds signiﬁcant value for further
investigation (33). The SLC6A4 gene can encode the serotonin
transporter (5-HTT) protein, which has the job to control the
release of serotonin (5-HT) from the synaptic terminals remove
that from the synaptic cleft (39–42). Due to the importance of
serotonin in impacting OCD, it is understandable that SLC6A4
might be the potential bio-marker for OCD treatment (6, 14, 43).
Except for the polymorphism of 5-HTTLPR (SLC6A4) that previous
research had already done with (33), the C alleles of rs16965628
(SLC6A4) have also been suggested to potentially lead to alterations
in the serotonergic system (44). Therefore, rs16965628 is suitable for
investigation in the present study, as it could be considered as a highly
possible candidate gene foe OCD (40).
Moreover, GRIN2B seem also deserve the investigation as a
possible candidate gene for OCD treatment, due to the previous
ﬁnding of the association between G allele and OCD (45). Previous
studies suggested that there is a signiﬁcant correlation between the
rs1019385 polymorphism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate 2B
glutamate receptor (GRIN2B) and reduced glutamatergic
concentration (Glx) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC);
Individuals with the GG genotype demonstrated reduced Glx
compared to those carrying the T allele (45, 46). As the reduced
Glx was suggested to be related with OCD (47), rs1019385
(GRIN2B) could also be a suitable gene for investigation in the
present study.
Furthermore, as another possible candidate gene, Catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT) serves as a pivotal enzyme in the
metabolic deactivation of dopamine and norepinephrine
catecholamines, facilitating the catabolism of dopamine (DA) (48, 49).
The Met (A) allele of Val158Met (G to A), commonly referred to as
RS4680 (COMT), is proposed to decrease enzyme activity, elevate
cortical dopamine signaling, and potentially play a role in OCD
development (50, 51). Hence, RS4680 (COMT) emerges as another
pertinent gene for investigation in the current study.
Given the limited amount of research investigating RS4680
(COMT), RS16965628 (SLC6A4), and RS1019385 (GRIN2B) as
candidate genes for OCD treatment and their strong correlation
with OCD, the present study aimed to investigate whether the
polymorphism of those three genes would inﬂuence the therapeutic
effect of rTMS and SSRIs in individuals with OCD. To achieve the
aim, a study with an experimental, between-subject, double-blind
design was conducted, with the recruitment of 36 untreated
outpatients diagnosed with OCD.
Methods and materials
Participants
This study employed an experimental, between-subject, doubleblind design. The participants consisted of 36 untreated outpatients
diagnosed with OCD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria (Figure 1).
The mean age of the participants was 31.61, with 17 males (47.22%)
and 19 females (52.78%). The study was granted ethical approval by
the Ethics Committee of Wuxi Mental Health Center, China (clinical
trials registry number: [ChiCTR1900023641]). Each participant has
received informed consent before participating.

Genotyping & therapy
All participants were randomly assigned to two different groups
for an 8-week therapy. However, as the drop-out rate was extremely
high after the second week, this study only analyzed the data of the
ﬁrst two weeks. Peripheral blood samples (5 mL) were collected
from each participant using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) vacuum tubes for genotyping purposes, speciﬁcally
examining the polymorphism of RS4680 (COMT), RS16965628
(SLC6A4), and RS1019385 (GRIN2B). In the active rTMS group,
participants received 1-Hz rTMS over the pre-supplementary
motor area (pre-SMA) once per day, 5 days per week, for 2
weeks. The pre-SMA was identiﬁed as being 15% of the distance
from the inion to the nasion along the anterior plane to the Cz
(vertex) on the sagittal midline. For the sham rTMS group, the
Neurosoft sham coil was positioned at the same location. Both
groups received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as
part of their drug therapy. Further details regarding the genotyping
and therapy used in this study can be found elsewhere (33).
Assessments
Clinical evaluations were conducted at baseline and 2 weeks
following the treatment timeline using three measuring tools: the
Chinese version of Yale–Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (YBOCS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), and the 17item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). The Chinese
version of Y-BOCS was found to be a dependable computerized
cognitive test, noted for its repeatability, sensitivity, and strong
validity and reliability (33). There were also previous research
afﬁrmed the validity and sensitivity of the Chinese editions of
HAMD and HAMA, underscoring their suitability for gauging
clinical severity in patients and endorsing their ongoing
utilization in research settings (52).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, employing the chisquare test, Related-Samples Friedman’s Two-Way Analysis of
Variance, and the Scheirer-Ray-Hare Test. The Chi-square test was
used to test the categories data such as gender. The Mann–Whitney
test, Related-Samples Friedman’s Two-Way Analysis, and the ScheirerRay-Hare Test were used to test non-normally distributed data.
Results
Demographic characteristics of
enrolled subjects
Table 1 presents descriptive and statistical comparisons of the
active rTMS and sham rTMS groups. At baseline, there were no
signiﬁcant differences between the active and sham groups in terms
of demographics or baseline clinical ratings (Table 1).
Assessment of Y-BOCS, HAMA, and HAMD
The result shows that both SSRIs and rTMS augmentation of
SSRIs led to signiﬁcant improvements in assessment scores. The YBOCS scores demonstrated a signiﬁcant decrease over time. The
Scheirer-Ray-Hare test analysis results (Table 2) for the two-week
Y-BOCS assessment showed that the main effect of the therapy type
was not signiﬁcant (H = 2.91, p > 0.05), while the main effect of the
therapy duration was signiﬁcant (H = 12.19, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.12).

(2) = 17.44, p < 0.01, W = 0.55) and sham rTMS group (c2 (2) =
9.58, p < 0.01, W = 0.24). Post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signedrank tests was conducted with a Bonferroni correction applied,
resulting in a signiﬁcance level set at p < 0.017. In the active rTMS
group, Y-BOCS scores signiﬁcantly decreased from baseline to week
1 (Z = -2.96, p < 0.017) and from baseline to week 2 (Z = -3.33, p <
0.017), while the decrease from week 1 to week 2 was not signiﬁcant
(Z = -1.74, p = 0.082). Similarly, in the sham rTMS group, Y-BOCS
scores signiﬁcantly decreased from baseline to week 2 (Z = -2.45,
p<0.017), while the decrease from baseline to week 1 (Z = -2.12, p =
0.034) and from week 1 to week 2 (Z = -1.55, p = 0.120) was not
signiﬁcant (Table 3). HAMA scores exhibited signiﬁcant changes
after therapy in both the active group (c2 (2) = 7.77, p < 0.05,
W = 0.24) and sham group(c2 (2) = 11.40, p < 0.01, W = 0.29)
(Table 3). Besides, in the active rTMS group, a signiﬁcant
change in assessment scores was found both from baseline to
week 1 (Z = -2.81, p < 0.017) and from baseline to week 2 (Z =
-2.88, p < 0.017). In the sham rTMS groups, a signiﬁcant change was
only found between baseline and week 2 (Z = -2.66, p < 0.017)
(Table 3). Additionally, the analysis of the two-week HAMD
assessment showed that the main effect of the therapy duration
was signiﬁcant (H = 10.50, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.10) (Table 2). Patients in
the active rTMS group demonstrated a signiﬁcantly larger reduction
rate at week 1 compared to the patients in the sham group (U =
93.50, p < 0.05, r = 0.354) (Figure 2). The HAMD scores showed a
signiﬁcant decrease over time in both the active rTMS (c2 (2) =
16.00, p < 0.05, W = 0.50) and sham rTMS groups (c2 (2) = 11.86,
p < 0.05, W = 0.30) (Table 3).
Effects of genotype on RS4680,
RS16965628 and RS1019385
The ﬁrst signiﬁcant difference was observed in the RS4680
genotype. No signiﬁcant differences were found in general
baseline characteristics between different genotypes. However,
signiﬁcant genotype-related effects on the intervention outcomes
were identiﬁed (Table 4). Patients with the GG genotype showed a
smaller improvement in Y-BOCS scores (H = 6.374, p < 0.05,

h2 = 0.19); and greater variability in Y-BOCS score was found in
Sham rTMS groups of GG genotype than in others. (Figure 3A).
Additionally, an interaction between rTMS intervention and
RS4680 genotype was found to have effects on HAMA (H =
4.645, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.14) and HAMD (H = 5.549, p < 0.05,
h2 = 0.17) scores at week 2, suggesting that genotypes may inﬂuence
the outcome of rTMS. Regarding the RS16965628 genotype, the
analysis results (Table 2) showed that the main effect of rTMS (H =
4.514, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.15) was signiﬁcant for the HAMD Week2
Reduction Rate. The rTMS intervention signiﬁcantly improved
HAMD scores to a greater extent in the active group, regardless
of whether patients had the GC or GG genotype, compared to the
sham group; and the improvement of the HAMD score of patients
carrying the GC genotype are more concentrated than the
improvement of the patients with GG genotype (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, the RS16965628 genotype exerted a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the reduction of HAMD scores (H = 6.361, p < 0.05,
h2 = 0.20), with patients carrying the GG genotype showing greater
improvement compared to C allele carriers (Table 4 and Figure 3B).
However, the interaction between intervention type and genotype
did not impact the rate of HAMD score reduction (H = 0.024, p >
0.05) (Table 4). For RS1019385, polymorphism of the gene also
demonstrated a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on HAMA score reduction
(H = 6.057, p < 0.05, h2 = 0.19). Speciﬁcally, individuals with the
CC genotype exhibited greater improvement in HAMA scores
compared to those with other genotypes; and the reduction rate
of the HAMA score are found to be more volatility in AC genotype
carrier (Figure 3C).
Discussion
The present study provides evidence that both SSRIs and rTMS
augmentation of SSRIs led to signiﬁcant improvements in OCD
symptoms following a two-week intervention. Additionally,
polymorphisms of RS4680, RS16965628, and RS1019385, were
found to be associated with treatment response. The study reveals
that individuals with the GG allele of RS4680 (COMT) exhibited a
relatively poorer response in terms of reducing Y-BOCS scores, not
only to SSRIs treatment but also to combined treatment involving
SSRIs and rTMS. This ﬁnding may be attributed to the decreased
susceptibility of patients with the GG allele (RS4680) to rTMS or the
combination treatment. RS4680, also known as Val158Met (G to
A), is closely linked to the risk of OCD (50, 51). It has been
suggested that the Met (A) allele reduces the enzyme activity,
enhances cortical dopamine signaling, and contributes to OCD.
This explanation aligns with the current study’s ﬁnding that
patients with the GG allele of RS4680 lack the A (Met) allele and
are therefore less susceptible to both OCD and its treatments (50).
Regarding the serotonin transporter protein gene (SLC6A4), no
signiﬁcant association was observed between different genotypes
and Y-BOCS scores. However, the C allele at RS16965628 (SLC6A4)
predicted improvements in HAMD scores, indicating that patients
with the C allele may be more responsive to rTMS augmentation

exerts a substantial impact on the Y-BOCS score, as evidenced by its statistical signiﬁcance (p<0.05). The table shows the interquartile and median of
the boxplot. (B) Impacts of gene locus RS16965628 on the HAMD reduction at week 2. The gene locus RS12965628 exerts a notable inﬂuence on
the reduction of the HAMD score, as evidenced by its statistically signiﬁcant effect (p<0.05). The table shows the interquartile and median of the
boxplot. (C) Impacts of gene locus RS1019385 on the HAMA reduction at week 2. The gene locus RS1019385 exerts a notable inﬂuence on the
reduction of the HAMD score, as evidenced by its statistically signiﬁcant effect (p<0.05). The table shows the interquartile and median of the boxplot.
The point shows the outlier.

therapy of SSRIs in reducing depressive symptoms. This result
could be said to keep consistent with previous experimental ﬁndings
on the association between the C allele and OCD patients (35, 44),
highlighting the strong connection between serotonin and the
depressive symptoms of OCD patients. The potential bio-marker
of the C allele in RS16965628 in SLC6A4 further supports the
notion proposed by Zhang (33) in 2019 that SLC6A4 could serve as
a candidate gene for the combined treatment of SSRI and rTMS.
Furthermore, the study results indicate that GG allele in RS1019385
signiﬁcantly beneﬁts in reducing HAMA scores, implying that patients
with this speciﬁc genotype may be more susceptible to rTMS
augmentation therapy of SSRIs in alleviating anxiety symptoms. This
ﬁnding might be seen as be supported by Arnold (45) who established a
signiﬁcant association between ACC Glx levels and the GRIN2BRS1019385 polymorphism, with individuals carrying the GG genotype
showing reduced Glx compared to T allele carriers. The G allele of
RS1019385 represents a variant in the promoter region, potentially
leading to decreased transcription and impacting glutamatergic
neurotransmission, thereby possibly contributing to OCD (45–47).
There are several limitations of this study, including a small
sample size, high drop-out rate and a short trial period of two weeks.
These may account for the low effect size of some of the results. These
limitations might have affected the reliability and validity of the
current study. Therefore, future research should include a larger and
more diverse sample size and conduct longer interventions, some
better welfare might be provided to minimize withdrawal rates.
In conclusion, the A allele of COMT RS4680, the C allele of
SLC6A4 RS16965628, and the GG allele of GRIN2B RS1019385 may
serve as bio-markers for the combined treatment of rTMS and
SSRIs in OCD, inﬂuencing Y-BOCS, HAMD, and HAMA scores,
respectively. Due to limitations in sample size and trial duration,
further research is needed to validate these ﬁndings. The ﬁndings of
this study provide valuable insights for further investigation and the
implementation of precision treatment for OCD.
